            Chris recently lost some weight, but still drinks as much. Mike spends a lot of time in his basement yelling into a bong. Together they have toured a decent percentage of the world and have five releases as 1994!. Join them as they plug one guitar into three amps, beat the shit out of some drums and vomit all over each others instruments. Yes, there is an exclamation point in their bandname. Yes, it annoys them went people don't include the exclamation point. Yes, they are truly stoked to be playing the fest for their forth year in a row.				</description>

            The Chicago scene has always been known for its gritty and honest punk rock defined by bands like Naked Raygun, Screeching Weasel, and 88 Fingers Louie. Newcomers ALL EYES WEST, no strangers themselves to the Chicago scene, are continuing in its great tradition with the release of their self-titled debut LP on Jump Start Records. All Eyes West came together in the summer of 2010 and is lead by vocalist/bassist Justin Miller's emotionally charged lyrics which have been a signature to bands like Signsedso and indie rockers Hinter. Guitarist Jeff Dean is known for the sound that has defined bands like The Bomb(with Jeff Pezzati of Naked Raygun) , Noise By Numbers, and Explode And Make Up.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In a relatively short amount of time the band has managed to build an impressive resume, touring both the US &amp; UK, playing with bands like OFF! Alkaline Trio, Seaweed, Samiam, Rival Schools, Braid, and Soul Control.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band's self-titled effort was recorded at Million Yen Studios by guitarist Jeff Dean and mastered by Jon Drew (Tokyo Police Club, Fucked Up).  On it, the band pays homage to 90's rock giants like Swervedriver, Drive Like Jehu, Jawbreaker, and Husker Du.				</description>

        <description>
            American Pinup formed in 2010, emerging from the suburban sprawl and unsung underground music scene of Westchester County, New York. The indie/punk four-piece combines elements of rockabilly, surf rock, punk, pop, folk, and ska to create a unique and fresh alternative sound, and has been pegged by AMP magazine as the "voice of the new decade." Blending the DIY ethos of the punk scene with a reverence for the melody and simplicity intrinsic to pop music, American Pinup has carved out their own niche in the world of independent music.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Frontwoman Lauren West combines soulful, melodic crooning with raspy, punk rock vocals, adding dimension to their hooky composititions and energetic live performances. In the DIY tradition, the band produced their debut LP independently in drummer Andy Porta's basement studio. It quickly caught the attention of Altercation Records, who signed the quartet and released the record, Strange Creatures, in February 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            American Pinup has appeared at festivals such as SXSW, Red Gorilla, and Valley of the Vapors since their debut release. In February 2012, they released a split album with New Jersey's Lost In Society on Altercation Records and spent March on a co-headlining national tour in support of the release. They will be returning to the studio in June 2012 to record their sophomore full-length, due out in late 2012. 				</description>

            Formed in Melbourne in 2008 as a side project to the various bands they were playing in, ANCHORS started as a way for the guys to get back to the sort of music they grew up on. Furiously technical and interlocked with bitter melodies, the band quickly became the main focus for all the members.  Their debut album BAD JUJU was released in 2010 and led to spots on the Soundwave and Push-Over festivals in Australia, as well as a tour of Japan. ANCHORS' sophomore album is due out in mid-2012.				</description>

        <description>
            At their core, Andrew Jackson Jihad is a band made up of a social worker and a gravedigger. Starting in 2004 and hailing from Phoenix, Arizona, they make music that attempts to understand and explain human nature. The music focuses on the horrid and beautiful ways that people treat each other, as well as the possibility that one day we will be able to reconcile these two forces.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Traditionally playing live as a two-person band (Sean Bonnette: guitar, vocals. Ben Gallaty: upright bass, vocals), Andrew Jackson Jihad's show is a cathartic experience that invites the audience to sing along. With the energy of a punk band, they blaze through song after song, while stopping occasionally to interact with their audience. Their lyrics are tragic yet humorous, crass yet intelligent, heartbreaking yet uplifting. One listener has described the music as "sad in the key of happy."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In September of 2011, AJJ released their fourth studio album Knife Man on Asian Man Records. The record was met with favorable reviews from media outlets such as Alternative Press (4/5 stars), Verbicide (9th best album of the year) and The Needle Drop among others. 				</description>

            "Get up! Your voices are needed!" Justin Sane shouts on Anti Flag's 8th studio album, The General Strike, due out on March 20th, 2012, on Side One Dummy. It's a rallying cry that shares a sentiment with a lot of Anti Flag songs, the call to arms of private citizens to stand up to governmental power and corporate injustice. The difference is that this album, born in the midst of the biggest wave of mass protests the US has seen in over 40 years, is speaking the language of the kids who are already occupying parks, lobbies and plazas all across America. The General Strike finds Anti Flag right where they belong, out in the crowd, alongside the occupying protesters in every major city in the increasingly dissatisfied modern world, screaming their pointed, politically charged slogans over some of their most ambitious tracks to date. And this time, the world is singing with them.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Without compromising their trademark style, The General Strike finds Anti Flag bounding effortlessly from the Hot Water Music-esque 1915 to the hardcore of Bullshit Opportinist to the frenetic, reggae-influenced energy of This Is The New Sound, an anti-wage slavery anthem which highlights Justin and the gang's tight, reckless virtuosity and effortless hooks. Not to be outdone, Chris number 2 alternately screams, whispers and bellows out anthems of his own like the bounding folk tinged Turn a Blind Eye, a song that seems to sum up the 99 percent's frustration with the lack of accountability at the top in less than one and a half minutes. Backing up Justin and Number 2, guitarist Chris Head shreds furiously while Pat Thetic pummels out some of the best, angriest drumming of his career. There's plenty to be pissed about in the dawn of 2012, and Anti Flag have taken aim on The General Strike.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Recorded in the Pittsburgh studio that Anti Flag built with money they made from dissolving their RCA deal, The General Strike was literally forged inside a monument to the redistribution of corporate wealth, and mixed by their old friend, Justin Francis. The results are 12 tracks that find Anti Flag doing what they do best in a way that they've never really done it before. The General Strike is equal parts reggae and hardcore, modern folk punk and traditional Clash influenced dance punk. It's reckless and tight, aggressive, experimental and unabashed in its influences. In short, it's the kind of record that could only be made by a seasoned band in their own studio, operating on their own time and working with old friends.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Of course, Anti Flag is more than just Pittsburgh basements and catchy songs. They're also a relentless touring force and outspoken activists. In the time since 2009's The People Or The Gun came out, Anti Flag has shared stages and protest ground all over the world with amazing individuals and groups. 2009-2010 saw Anti Flag go to Russia, as well as South America for the first time. They played the Vans Warped tour, the UK's massive Redding and Leeds festivals, Soundwave in Australia, Canadian dates with My Chemical Romance, the Vans Off the Wall European tour, Ruisrock in Helsinki, Pukkelpop in Belgium and high profile local shows like Home for the Holidays with the Bouncing Souls and Florida's Harvest of Hope festival, which provides emergency educational and financial relief to migrant farm workers&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            and their families.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            No strangers to throwing their name behind good causes, the Flag also lent their ferocious live set to the Gay Edge Liberation benefit in Cologne Germany and Positive Force DC. Recently, Anti Flag brought their punk philanthropy to the UK for Wherever the Need, which supports clean water projects. They've been extremely active and vocal in the Occupy Wall Street movement. Even for a band who's shared stages with such massive and diverse acts as Rage Against the Machine and Bjork and headlined a festival of 50,000 Germans, it's been a banner year of pushing forward for Anti Flag, not only in terms of touring, but also visible activism.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            So what's next for Anti Flag? Well besides heading to Southeast Asia for the first time, where they'll hit Thailand, Jakarta and Hong Kong, a run of US tour dates, a headlining stint on the Warped Tour, Australian and European dates, including a stop at Groezrock, you can bet that wherever there are dissatisfied people gathering together in the name of changing the status quo, the guys in Anti Flag will be there, side by side, sharing the slogans and songs, the kicks to the ribs and the parties until there's nothing left to fight for or no parties left to overthrow, or at the very least, the last partiers go home.				</description>

            Antillectual is a punkrock trio from Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The group is considered the hardest working punkrock band in Europe for touring and releasing albums worldwide since 2005. Antillectual's punkrock is political and melodic, combining the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            best of '90's skatepunk, '00's emo and '10's orgcore. The band carries the torch of current European punkrock.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

        <description>
            Owing their sound to the dual influences of Americana roots rock and gritty, bearded punk, Arliss Nancy formed in 2007 in Fort Collins, Colorado.  From the outset, singer-songwriter Cory Call seemed to excel at juxtaposing the simplicity of the classic American blue-collar songwriter with the subtlety and nuance of a well-read, withdrawn poet.  Now, with nearly 5 years, 2 full length albums and 2 EPs under their belt, that dichotomy is as persistent as ever with the introduction of bassist Kyle Oppold as half the songwriting force behind Arliss Nancy's Suburban Home Records debut, Simple Machines. The record will be immediately palatable to fans of alt-country mainstays like Lucero and Two Cow Garage, but the discerning ear will hear hints of a wide array of influences from the dingy gravel of Midwestern pop punk to the whimsical balladry of Bruce Springsteen. Arliss Nancy's sound is a triumph of contrasts, and they aim to prove it with Simple Machines.				</description>

            DC Talk (styled as dc Talk), is a Grammy-winning Christian rock music trio. The group was formed in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They have released five major studio albums together: DC Talk (1989), Nu Thang (1990), Free at Last (1992), Jesus Freak (1995), and Supernatural (1998). In 2002, the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music called DC Talk "the most popular overtly Christian act of all time." Arms Aloft, on the other hand are just a bunch of shitheads. Hail Satan.				</description>

            Blasting out of a dirty basement's rehearsal room there comes the straight forward punkrock sound of Austria's very own ASTPAI. Think of Strike Anywhere meets AC/DC, never lacking a sense in melody and sing-a-longs. Their Hardcore/Punk sound comes along with both very personal as well as political views and offers some new ideas without just presenting shallow paroles and drained statements.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            ASTPAI has been a consistently touring band for five years now, including destinations such as Western-, Central-, and Eastern Europe as well as the USA, Canada and Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In a total of ten years the band has shared stages with numerous international acts like Anti-Flag, Flogging Molly, Left-over Crack, Fucked Up, Paint It Black, The Flatliners, Dead To Me, The Casting Out (Ex-Boysetsfire) and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            ASTPAI will be putting out their fourth and strongest full-length "Efforts And Means" in early May 2012, just in time to promote it throughout the summer and on several tours on the European mainland, UK and North America.				</description>

            *Banner Pilot's* a quartet of beer swilling, bookworm punks from Minneapolis who play the kind of gritty pop-punk that seems so synonymous with the Midwest. Three years ago they dropped *Collapser*, their second full length on Fat Wreck Chords, which was so beloved that it even appeared on Punknews.org's best of 2009 list.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            A quick background check reveals that *Banner Pilot* started in 2006 out playing their take on dark, midwesty sounding punk rock a-la Jawbreaker, the Alkaline Trio and the Lawrence Arms with a fucking drum machine (they've since acquired a live-flesh drummer). Some of the dudes used to be in Rivethead, an outfit that also boasts members of Dear Landlord. One of the guys works at Wells Fargo or Target or something. One of the guys was the studio bassist for all the Off With Their Heads records. They used to be on Go Kart, who put out their debut full-length, *Resignation Day*, before they signed with Fat who dropped the aforementioned *Collapser* in 2009. There. We up to speed? Okay, then let's get this baby up to 88 and check out the future.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            They just released *Heart Beats Pacific*, described by the band as "*Collapser* on steroids" - it was recorded at the Terrarium by Jacques Wait, who also recorded Off With Their Heads, Dear Landlord, and The Soviettes. When pressed for a blurb about the HBP, *Banner Pilot* said:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Whenever a band starts a new album, they have a choice to take a step backwards.... Or take a step forwards. We chose to take a step backwards. That gave us more room to jump two steps forward. What does that mean? Better songs, but still in the same vein as before. A few new things that make the album less straight-forward, but not in a weird way. Thicker guitars, and an overall better sound. We even cracked out a grand piano for a four-count-em-four note piano part. New things, but we don't abandon or ignore our old sound."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            2012 will mark BPs 7th visit to Fest.  Get stoked!				</description>

            Bear Trade is punk band based in Sunderland in the North East of England. We've all been around the block more times than we care to remember, but we're trying to remain positive. We are some men who have played in lots of other bands with a mutual love of the punk and the rock and the beers and the whiskey and the travel and the meeting new friends and the gigs and the just plain never getting too old for having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The songs which we make together are the result of this beautiful alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Bent Left is a dark, sociopolitical post posi-punk partycore band that meanders the countryside hung from nooses and puppet strings singing and dancing for the sake of their own entertainment and yours. Their liturgy promotes embracing one's own confusion and discomfort while wearing a smile all the while. Try it sometime. For fans of Fifteen, The Broadways, well gin and water.				</description>

        <description>
            Big Awesome's smooth, melodic layers and delicate sense of dynamics verify that technical control can evoke more meaningful emotion than animalistic abandon. And on Birdfeeder, the band's self-released four-song EP, they demonstrate this with a dexterity that is both obvious and difficult to define. In a genre that capitalizes on harsh, startling aesthetics to express itself, Big Awesome makes music that combines power with finesse. No, it's not necessarily as loud, but Birdfeeder feels denser and more memorable, more dynamic and meticulous, and captures more accurately the complex nature of emotion. Sure, those harsher songs may allow the listener to express something primitive; Big Awesome's songs summon the same, but add to it something more cerebral, making these songs, perhaps, even more human than the most barbaric tracks.				</description>

        <description>
            Billy Wallace first started touring the country playing music in 2004 as the singer and guitarist for the Roanoke, VA based indie-folk band, The Wading Girl and later as the bass player in Tim Barry's backing band. In 2009, Wallace set out on his own, releasing his debut album The Road Spit Me Out, in August of the same year. It got great reviews, but no one really cared. Nevertheless, he spent the next two years on the road, crisscrossing the whole of America time and again. His new record, Tucumcari, New Mexico and Other Songs, is an account of the friends - and sometimes enemies - he made, the people he loved and lost, the highways he wrecked cars on, and the towns he got drunk in along the way. Having returned to his town of birth, The Queen City, Cincinnati, OH, Wallace recruited some pretty amazing musicians - and downright good folks - to back him up on the new record. This latest incarnation of the Virginia Blues includes Matt Hemingway (The Dopamines, Black Tie Bombers, State Song), Jon Weidenbacher (Lost Hands Found Fingers, Shivs) and Mike Saylor (Team Stray) and a host of immensely talented others.				</description>

        <description>
            After years of touring, overcoming everything from member changes to terminal illness, Blacklist Royals DIY approach and die-hard spirit won the attention of Paper and Plastick Records (owned by former Fueled By Ramen founder, Vinnie Fiorello); Gunner Records also supported the band's European release, alongside their catalogue of bands such as Frank Turner and Gaslight Anthem. Both labels released Blacklist Royals' critically acclaimed debut full-length album, "Semper Liberi" in late 2010.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            After having spent 2010 touring across the United States and Canada, appearing at SXSW, Harvest of Hope, the Gainesville Fest and more, Blacklist Royals kicked off 2011 by showcasing the song, "Churchbells are Ringing" on the hit television series, "Sons of Anarchy," on the FX Network, followed by a run of sold-out shows with Less Than Jake.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In the early spring, Blacklist Royals embarked on an extremely successful European tour, including dates supporting Dropkick Murphys, NOFX, and performing at the sold-out Groezrock Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Following that, Blacklist Royals announced a split 7" with Hellcat Record's Boston Punk Rock stalwarts, Street Dogs, just in time to begin their second appearance on the Vans Warped Tour.  Complimenting the tour, Blacklist Royals contributed an unreleased song to the SideOneDummy Warped Tour compilation.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band has spent 2012 so far gearing up for their sophomore release with the release of a flexi-disc single on Trever Keith from Face To Face's new label Folsom Records, along with playing the Shirts For A Cure 10th Anniversary at SXSW and gearing up for a main-stage slot at Pouzza Fest in Montreal.				</description>

        <description>
            Another Year marks the second effort by Andre and Augusto Pagliarini, collectively known as Boardroom Heroes.  The album offers twelve short bursts of smart verses, sing-a-long choruses and velocity - lots of velocity.  Had it been written in the late nineties, Another Year would be right at home along side NOFX's So Long and Thanks for all the Shoes and Lagwagon's Let's Talk About Feelings; but in 2012, it sounds furious and fresh.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The duo grew up splitting time between Brazil and the US, where their older brother turned them on to bands like Bad Religion and Pennywise.  They ventured out to California to play in a band before rooting themselves in Bethesda, Maryland for the past several years.  In 2010, they quietly self-released Boardroom Heroes, a project they wrote themselves.  Over the next two years they would continue to write what would become Another Year, which was recorded by Mike Bridgett (Turnover, Let's Be Honest) at the Monster House in Waldorf, MD. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Thematically, Another Year addresses the inevitability of change - and the anxieties and hopes that stem from the unknown.  The lyrics are brainy and reflective, but reeled off at a break-neck, spitfire pace.  Meanwhile, the instrumentation is every bit as rapid, and every bit as carefully nuanced.  The result is a rare, honest punk rock record - one that holds up well in any era. 				</description>

        <description>
            Bone Dance, a ritually charged and menacingly DIY band seeped in all things heavy, takes the grime and gravelly glut of aggressive music and reevaluates not only its intensity, but also its heritage: retooling the ferocity of hardcore, the technical acumen of extreme metal, and the minimal gauze of sludge and doom, this is the kind of tight, controlled, anvil-heavy music that only comes out of an area dominated by the Religious Right, the Conservative Coalition, and some of the most culturally repressive mechanisms in America. Bone Dance acts as a document of this inheritance by time and place, and on principle, rejects all of it. As a combatant to the moderate veneer that glosses even the counterculture in their hometown of Boise, Idaho, Bone Dance have crafted not a shield, but a weapon against the repressive devices they so clearly detest. By deconstructing typical sludge breakdowns, by retooling blast beats into searing grooves, by inverting a biblical poetic into a sinister manifest of their body politic, Bone Dance forges a musical dialogue exemplifying the clash typical of the liberal/conservative head-butting seen throughout misleading media; however, the band seems to reject even mainstream leftist views in favor of an utter desert-driven nihilism. Bone Dance proves yet again that the frontier isn't innovation - the frontier is misery.				</description>

            Brian McGee sings and plays guitar in Plow United, again. When the band broke up in the late 90's, Brian hit the road for Cherokee County, NC in Sadi (Plow van). Not far from where Eric Rudolph was hiding out, Brian learn how to chop wood, make banjos, can food, and play three hour long square dances. He learned how to make furniture. He got drunk, met a good woman, got sober, got married, got drunk again and agreed to move to NJ with his wife. He was on tour with PJ Bond in 2011 when he go the call on a cellular phone, asking if Plow United would get back together to play Riot Fest East in 2011. The band answered with a resounding "SI!" Plow United is now set to release a new album in early 2013 on Jumpstart Records and Brian is working on his next solo release which will be out in 2013 as well. Nowadays he turns up the thermostat when he's cold, fixes guitars for punk bands and buys his canned food at the Stop N' Shop.				</description>

            Remember when indie music was wild and unpredictable? Remember when bands were hard to pigeonhole into neat little sub-genres? Well, Cattle Drums will remind you if you have forgotten. Hailing from upstate NY, you might shrug your shoulders at a band named Cattle Drums but you would be remiss by doing so. Mixing post-punk, emo/hardcore, shards of math rock and even traces of dark Americana, Cattle Drums distinguish themselves as purveyors of a sound not yet recognizable to our pampered, innocent ears. Lyrically ambiguous and instrumentally ambitious with harsh, aggressive tones, Cattle Drums truly are a wild awakening for the senses. These songs truly defy classification and open the listener up to create their own unique interpretation of the Cattle Drums sound. Need a shock to the system to break you from the mundane of the daily grind? Delve into the madness of the Cattle Drums experience and witness a band operating only by their keen sense of artistic expression. Eccentric and chaotic yet always melodic and intoxicating, Cattle Drums are kicking up dust and noise unlike anybody else right now. Just imagine what is yet to come.				</description>

            Caves is a three-piece punk group from southern England. Heartfelt and catchy lyrics are delivered by guitarist Lou Hanman (Flamingo 50), who is backed up by great bass lines and harmonies from Jonathan Minto, and rock solid drumming from Dave Brent, the most organized man in punk rock.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            This is their second (third?) appearance at Fest.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Ceremony are a punk band from Rohnert Park, California, just outside of San Francisco. Their three albums on the Deathwish and Bridge 9 labels are widely seen as the most compelling, unusual and progressive hardcore of the last five years.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            For their Matador debut Zoo, produced by John Goodmanson (Blood Brothers, Sleater-Kinney, Girls, Weezer), the band have refined their jagged sound while continuing to pursue themes of exurban alienation and confinement.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Zoo explores punk and post-punk traditions:the rhythm section remains as tense and propulsive as ever, while guitarist Anthony Anzaldo moves with ease from ringing power chords to stealthy leads reminiscent of Gang of Four and The Cramps. Ross Farrar's future primitive vocals sometimes recall Pink Flag or Metal Box, ranging from a melodic howl to a muttered incantation.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The result is gripping and indelible. 				</description>

            Choke Up is four best buds from Boston who love The Weakerthans and King of the Hill. They would probably be a 50s-style pop band if they weren't so sad and angry all the time. Choke Up certainly aren't your typical hardcore band, that is for sure. The band plays dark and emotional melodic hardcore with several different elements at war. With powerful vocals that will stay with you long after, Choke Upâs thick brand of impassioned hardcore is breath of fresh air in a stagnant scene. The band just finished recording songs for an upcoming 2012 release and the only responsible member is currently booking up a storm that includes Summer / Fall dates along the Eastern seaboard. So whether you're into "post-hardcore/screamo," "impassioned hardcore," "melodic hardcore/indie/screamo," or something with both "punk AND pop melodies," you should come party with Choke Up.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Cigarette Crossfire is the latest addition to Combat Rock Industry's roster. The band plays guitar-driven, politically charged, rough yet catchy punk rock in the vein of Hot Water Music, Leatherface and Finland's own Manifesto Jukebox. Continuing the legacy of the hard-working bands on the label, Cigarette Crossfire started touring internationally right after their first seven-inch.. and with a raging debut album released in November 2011, there's no end in sight for the band!				</description>

        <description>
            When Devin from the Cobra Skulls sat down to write Agitations, the third Cobra Skulls full length and first for Fat Wreck Chords, due out Sept. 27, he found himself in a different situation than he'd ever been in before. I'll let him tell you all about it:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "In the past I've always written songs sporadically and when it seemed as though a song wanted to write itself, but for our new album, Agitations, the process was a little different because time was a bit of a constraint. I had less than a month to write an entire album. Solitude was definitely a necessity for me to write - so I moved into a cheap, dirty, weekly motel in Reno.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The result is thirteen of the most blistering, concise Cobra Skulls songs ever assembled in album form. Only one track clocks in at over three minutes and as usual, the band is almost incomprehensibly angry at the world at large. No target is too weird, too outside the normal realm of traditional punk angst for the Cobra Skulls. Agitations sets its sites on the crumbling economy, our unsustainable auto-obsessed culture, the xenophobia bred in the post 9-11 political climate, their own families and friends and prisons that are run like profit-turning businesses. Nothing's spared in the latest from these hyper-intelligent, incisive, uncompromising, politically charged, lovelorn misanthropes, but that's par for the course for an album from Reno's favorite sons.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Formed in 2005 in the Biggest Little City in the World, Cobra Skulls began packing basements and garages around the southwest before catching the attention of Red Scare Industries in 2006, where they dropped two full lengths and began to make noise on a more national level. Fat Mike eventually got the message that an angry punk band with an unclassifiable sound that seemed to simultaneously worship Bad Religion, the Misfits, The Clash, and Mike Ness's rockabilly songs was making the rounds, so he signed 'em up in a hurry and helped them put out the critically acclaimed 2011 ep Bringing the War Home.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            When it was time for a debut Fat Wreck full length, the Cobra Skulls hit Motor Studios in San Francisco (NOFX, Lagwagon, pretty much everything on Fat from the 90') to record Agitations, the results are 13 songs that Fat Mike has since referred to as "the best" Cobra Skulls album to date. In the words of Devin:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Every song has a distinct personality. Some are fast, some are mid-tempo. Some songs sound influenced by blues, rockabilly, pop and some even have hints of jazz, funk and folk, but all songs are rooted in an old school punk spirit."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The Cobra Skulls are renowned for their nonstop touring and the cycle for Agitations will be no exception. For starters, they'll be hitting the whole of North America with Nothington, including a stop at the Fest in Gainesville. After that, you know how it goes. They're going around the world to scream about the fucked up injustices that plague the world in both English and Spanish. And if you don't speak either of those? Well, you can just marvel at the seamless blending of punk, ska, blues, jazz and rockabilly that the Cobra Skulls are known for. Or you can explain how you've read this bio, because that's pretty impressive too.				</description>

            Fresh out of high school and with an average age of 18 years old, Pennsylvania's Code Orange Kids remind us off our own embryonic days in the aggressive music scene. They do things their way, creatively cutting their own path through it all. Unconcerned with the direction of other artists, their brand of gritty hardcore/punk is simply refreshing to hear. Merging cryptic melody, dirty hardcore power, and intense dirge into their own uniquely inspired sound.				</description>

            Hi, we are Coffee Project.  I am not really sure what to say, but I do know how much we appreciate you guys going nuts for us every year during the fest!  We have been called everything under the sun, mostly stuff about ska (weird) and cats (i get that one).  We released an EP called "Concrete Boots" a few months ago via Paper and Plastick records.  By the time the FEST rolls around, we will have been part of a split 7inch with the awesome band Arliss Nancy, also being released on Paper and Plastick.  Thanks!   Jake and Buddy/Coffee Project.				</description>

            "The Philadelphia quartet's impressive debut transcends typical motifs - drifting verses cutting to skyrocketing refrains, and discovers true interplay... Lyrics broadly address addiction, innocence lost, ennui, depression, hope and love. It's aggressive, introspective and a strong opening statement from an exciting band." - Magnet Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Philadelphia's CREEPOID mine the quiet side of breathy acoustic / slowcore, then erupt into heavy, hard hitting distortion, all within the course of their debut album "Horse Heaven," and sometimes within a single song. They are kindred spirits (and tour-mates) with bummercore champions Shores, with whom they'll also be releasing a split EP later next month.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Consisting of members Sean Miller (guitars / vocals), Anna Troxell (bass / vocals) and husband Pat Troxell (drums), and Pete Joe Urban (guitar), CREEPOID will be reissuing their debut full-length album "Horse Heaven" on March 20th courtesy of their new label home No Idea Records. Produced, engineered and mixed by Kyle "Slick" Johnson (Wavves, Modest Mouse, Love As Laughter, The Hives) at Fancy Time Studios in Philadelphia, "Horse Heaven" recalls the likes of Mazzy Star, Goodnight Loving, and the warmest blend of dark, lush, and eerie in an acoustic / electric hybrid.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In addition to being handpicked by R5's Sean Agnew to be featured in their own episode of Weathervane Music &amp; WXPN's "Shaking Through"Â (Watch: http://bit.ly/q7Xc40), in the past year alone Creepoid have appeared on NPR's "World Cafe" Next,Â and were named The Deli Magazine's "Best of Philly 2011" Poll for Emerging Artists.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            We reckon that CREEPOID have an appreciation for Nick Cave, Red House Painters, and Spain, as well as a compulsion for old records, analog recording gear, and late night hours spent in dank basements. Recommended for fans of Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Yo La Tengo, and My Bloody Valentine.				</description>

            Though not a household name, musician, artist, puppeteer, and actor David Liebe Hart has been a cult personality in for decades. In 1988, he followed the guidance of his Sunday School teacher Jim Henson and began producing The Junior Christian Science Bible Lesson Program on public access television.  Eventually the show caught the eye of Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, who cast Liebe Hart to sing his bizarre songs on their hit Cartoon Network show, Tim and Eric's Awesome Show, Great Job!.  David's positive, stream of consciousness songs focus on the topics most important to him; beautiful women, famous actors, and his sincere belief in UFO's.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Since being âdiscovered" by Tim and Eric in 2006, David Liebe Hart has performed to sell-out crowds with the comedians, worked with John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill, and appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live.  In 2010, he formed a punk band with his frequent collaborator Adam Papagan.  During the past year, they have performed at CMJ, Fun Fun Fun Fest, and SXSW, and shared the stage with The Thermals, Lemuria, Shonen Knife, Thee Oh Sees, Born of Osiris, Jacuzzi Boys, and many others.  David has taken the recognition he's found so late in life in stride.  When asked to describe his music, Liebe Hart responds simply, âPeace, love, and punk rockÂ".				</description>

            Rock n' Roll is the business of orphans. That's why we reinvent ourselves in fake last names/band names to replace our inherited surnames. Because to be a wild, drooling cretin you can't have the old war dragging behind you. It's the reason why we get dropped off around the corner or don't bring our uncles out to slam pits. It's not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            We all know the dichotomy of "Cool"Â. "Cool" is a phenomenon of "Did you see that guy's haircut?"Â or "I became friends with Sarah because she walked into Chemistry class with a homemade Buzzcocks t-shirt." Cool is a currency to relate to one another but also decides where the circle of acceptance ends. It says things like "This isn't for everyone"Â or "We are now what you want to be, but aren't" which can be an intimidating thing.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Inclusion"Â, the bait on the hook of religion, family, popular dance music, etc , is the flip side. As human beings, inherently insecure, we are prey for acceptance. But this blanket inclusion, that does not ask anything from the individual, carries the price of conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Rock bands have been the spokesman of youth and the flag ship of cool for the past 50 or so years. The more concentrated you get; Rock n' Roll narrowing to punk, Punk narrowing to the DIY scene; the, presumably, more steeped in cult behavior things become: coded symbols, eating garbage, fringe ethics; the more the circle of acceptance is tightened.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            It is here that Delay* lives.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            My favorite thing about them is, in contrast to this theory, they are an inclusive band; yet they are not sanitized, bland, pretentious, insulting moralizing, or safe. They understand the currency of "Cool"Â as a tool used to unite a network of friends to foster support in a community where people are able to engage in positive positive projects directly, or in other words: "Be a part of what we are doing and we want to be a part of what you are doing as well" The feeling is that this community should be available to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            I suppose this is a result of starting a band when you're 13 because Delay carries with them a familial vibe in which it is hard to separate the band from their circle of friends. It's also a vibe that makes it a natural act for a member to read a letter from his Grandmother on stage (She heard a Foo Fighters song on the radio and didn't understand their appeal over Delay) or also the vibe that makes another member bop around at a show playing "air guitar" to a band; a terribly uncool move because usually it comes off as needy emulation (or confused mockery?) of the person 4 feet from you. In this case the wide smile and, because of the amount and frequency the knees bent made it come off as "Hey! Check this out, this is kinda funny - wait, how about this? Ha ha"Â Your family doesn't really care about how weird you are. It's this sort of effort to relate that washes away the stoic mistakes of "Cool", Rock n' Roll, and in a large sense oppressive American culture, in lieu of saying "This is where we are going now and this is how we want to treat each other"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            *Delay is a moniker given to a musical group. 2 of the 3 members are brothers who share the same face. 2 of the 3 members have the same haircut and share no genetic material. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            They play the kind of pop punk that has buzzsaw guitars and tries to perfect the same song over and over. Recently they switched from 45 rpms to 33 rpms.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            4 guys from that Mediterranean country in crisis, thats been hitting the headlines a bit too often the last couple years.  Spending their hard earned money once again to tour the US hoping they won't get pistol whipped this time on their way down to Gainesville. Released so far two 7" and a split 10" with lnxSane. Toured Europe and the US a few times, and still getting stopped in each and every border.				</description>

            Dikembe is a band from Gainesville, FL. Steven, Kenny, David, and Grimble first started Dikembe when they were all squatting an abondoned firehouse in Gainesville known as the Crust Castle. The four individuals have funneled their influences of emo circa 1995-2004 through the space music of today to create something wholly unoriginal and only mildly inspiring. Sometimes they like to play loud because they think it is cool. Their first LP will be out on mini disc hobby label Tiny Engines this spring. 				</description>

            Simply put, Divided Heaven is Jeff Berman, an East Coast transplant living in Los Angeles with a voice and a guitar. On record and stage, Divided Heaven is a punk band without the amplification, singing stories rooted in history and politics, travel and experience, love and hope.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            After tours on both coasts and two appearances at the FEST, the first Divided Heaven full-length "Rival City" has been picked by Vinnie Fiorello of Less Than Jake to be released for free via digital download through Paper + Plastick Records &amp; FreeMusicFirst.org. 'A Rival City' is now also available on LP through No Panic! Records (Germany) and on limited edition CDs through Berman himself.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Berman, who also plays guitar in Protagonist and fronts the LA-based HeartRacers, is fresh off a European tour with the SNIPS and is excited to be part of FEST 11!!				</description>

        <description>
            Dwarves began in Chicago as a teen garage rock outfit called the Suburban Nightmare, a sound that was partially carried over into the first Dwarves release, 1986's Horror Stories. After the first album,Dwarves.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Dwarves unsurprisingly self-destructed shortly after a failed hoax, whereby the band issued a press release stating that guitarist He Who Cannot Be Named had died. The album Sugarfix also carried a tribute to the guitarist, who was actually very much alive. Sub Pop was not amused and dropped the band, which later re-formed for 1997's Young and Good Looking. Come Clean followed in early 2000. Four years later the band returned with The Dwarves Must Die, including guests Dexter Holland from the Offspring,Nick Oliveri from Queens of the Stone Age, Nash Kato from Urge Overkill, and voice actor Gary Owens. In 2009 the band began to work on a new album, this time recruiting past members of the band like Salt Peter and Vadge Moore to play on the album instead of an all-star celebrity cast and released The Dwarves Are Born Again in 2010.				</description>

            Elway is a former Navy SEAL captain who is now the cook aboard&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            the USS Missouri. Everyone aboard is about to celebrate the birthday of Captain Adams. They've even hired a band led by William Strannix, and former playboy playmate Steve Niemoczynski to jump out of a cake and dance. What Adams doesn't know is that he is in for a deadly surprise. Strannix has Adams killed and takes the ship to steal its nuclear missiles, spreading his men, including Commander Krill, throughout the ship, but Strannix and his men are underestimating Elway. Elway is an expert in martial arts, weapons, tactics, and explosives. After crossing paths with Niemoczynski, Elway lets him tag along on his mission to stop Strannix.  In 1992 a battleship's been sabotaged by nuclear pirates out to steal its warheads. Now, surrounded by terrorists, a lone band stands with a deadly plan of attack.				</description>

            Pieced together in the confines of a dark and musty New Brunswick basement in the fall of 1995, Ensign has managed to emerge as one of the area's most prominent and hardworking bands. Always at a pivotal and confrontational point of never exactly being in synch with the changing times around them, Ensign has fought and toured relentlessly, endearing themselves to an ever-increasing following of fans bridging both the punk and hardcore scenes. Too negative for the youth crew kids, too positive for the negative kids, too punk for hardcore and too hardcore for punk, they have found some form of gray area to exist within. There have been countless member changes in the past 16+ years Ensign has been around, however, the pairing of vocalist Tim Shaw and bassist Nathan Voorhees has proven to be the most consistent. With Tim's signature vocal styling and Nathan's continuous songwriting, Ensign has managed to maintain a common thread throughout the years and the changes. These two have constantly strode to take Ensign everywhere possible, both musically and literally. Ensign has shared the stage with the likes of Rancid, Avail, Hatebreed, Sick Of It All, Good Riddance, A.F.I., the Suicide Machines, H2O and countless others reaching many a shore and grassy knoll. Ireland, Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, England, Puerto Rico, Canada and the continental U.S. are all places that Ensign has called home at some point or another for days, weeks and months of touring. To date Ensign has released 3 ep's, 3 albums, 4 split ep's, a punk rock/hardcore covers album and are currently finishing work on a brand new EP entitled "Warning Shots". Continuous musical growth and consistent touring plans ensure that Ensign will be a band on the rise for years to come. Spark the revolution!				</description>

        <description>
            "Like some kind of demented side show, the Ex-Boogeymen have a knack for mesmerizing their audience. Whether it's by stripping all their clothes off, humping random audience members or dancing like some Baptist snake-handling crazies in the middle of a Sunday-morning frenzy, their shows always seem to be the buzz on the streets weeks after they take place.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Masters of Ceremony, the first release by these self-proclaimed devil-rockers, is a punk-rock homage to nightlife and other dark things. This album is simple punk and classic rock &amp; roll, rolled up in an almost surfy-goth vibe. Following the tradition of The Cramps, they utilize plenty of reverb, front man bravado and catchy two to three minute songs. They may not have completely invented the sound, but I like to refer to this band as a breath of fresh air. It is the kind of good time music that will itch your dance bone. Which is a welcome reprise in a town ruled by post-punk and sludge metal.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Like the old saying goes, once you invite a vampire into your house they can come and go as they please: this album is a vampire. Take it for a spin and Reverend Liaison will immediately sink his "hooks into you." The next thing you know you'll find yourself at an Ex-Boogeymen show, drinking cheap wine, surrounded by leather jackets and tattoos, getting those inexplicable spins. It won't be long until you find yourself speaking in tongues, dancing to their old-school-gothic-punk-rock vibe. If it's your first time seeing them don't be surprised if you wake up in a ditch covered in amniotic fluid. You will be reborn."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            In January of 1997, four basement walls in Nashville, Tennessee heard the embryonic first chords of From Ashes Rise. Fueled by the isolation of the small but tight-knit Hardcore Punk scene of the Southern US, the band, along with contemporaries His Hero Is Gone, would help usher in a new sound, influencing numerous international musical projects throughout the next 14 years. Drawing from a diverse pool of musical influences, ranging from the drop tuned darkness of Black Sabbath and the triumphant gloom of Amebix, to the furiously monotonous D-Beat of Discharge, they would blend these sounds with various stateside acts. Melding these European influences with material from the metal-tinged Southern crossover of Corrosion Of Conformity and the moody chaos of Neurosis, From Ashes Rise employed a dynamic songwriting approach, emphasizing musicianship while shunning excess. Backed by a unique tendency for melody in a minor key setting and frequent pace changes, the intelligently written lyrics of vocalists/ guitarists Brad Boatright and John Wilkerson screamed their gravelly angst over the pounding volume of Dave Atchison's drums. Possessing a live energy matched by few and a relentless urge to tour, the band would find themselves well received in the most strictly DIY sects of the punk scene, successfully crossing over to portions of the Heavy Metal and Alternative music scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 2001 the band relocated to Portland, OR, and with a shift in climate began work on the songs that would make up the Nightmares LP, released- to the surprise of many punk purists- by diverse indie label Jade Tree records. Continuing the lyrical theme of bleak social observations, and with dark but melodic musical framework, Nightmares would become the band's most polished release. In the few years that followed From Ashes Rise toured incessantly, and in 2005 found themselves imploding from the never-ending pressures and conflicts that naturally arose. Immediately following a tour with UK legends Subhumans, the band called it quits, and the four members went on to explore other musical endevours.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In late 2009,with countless tours, two EPs, a split with Swedish maniacs Victims, and three LPs behind them, Brad Boatright, Derek Willman, Dave Atchison, and John Wilkerson ended their hiatus and again rang the sirens of the apocalypse. Beginning with a show at Satyricon in Portland Oregon, and making stops in Montreal, Baltimore, Sweden, and Los Angeles, From Ashes Rise have finally proven the true meaning of their epithet.				</description>

            "When one door closes, another opens but it's hell in the hallway," says bass player Kenny Fletcher. "I kind of feel like that sums up everything we have been doing musically for the past 13 years." ...But it's Hell in the Hallway is the debut EP from New York City natives Gameday Regulars, and while the band may be new, the members are far from wet behind the ears. Veterans of the tri-state area DIY punk scene dating back over a decade, brothers Will and Gino Romeo, along with childhood friend Kenny Fletcher, have been in their fair share of local hopefuls. Gameday Regulars, however, is far from needing hope in order to secure future plans. Mightier Than Sword Records released ...But it's Hell in the Hallway on September 27th, and the band is touring more or less non-stop from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            ...But it's Hell in the Hallway was recorded in the Spring of 2011 by producer Gregory Dunn, singer of Westchester, NY's Moving Mountains, at his home studio in Cortland, NY. A relentless display of the band's influences (Jawbreaker, Hot Water Music, Samiam, Face To Face and Lucero, to name a few), the EP highlights where Gameday Regulars came from, while simultaneously showcasing the direction in which they are headed. Staying true to their distinct sound, the band has crafted an EP that packs a punch, while remaining constantly poetic and catchy from beginning to end. "The meaning of the lyrics on this record have to do with stories of people I have come across in life," says singer and guitar player Will Romeo, "battling addiction, depression, and misfortunes. In ways, I have related to their stories, which have helped craft these songs."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Hailing from the adjacent Bronx neighborhoods of Pelham Bay and Morris Park, Gino Romeo and Kenny Fletcher started a close friendship at the age of 14 in 1998. Will Romeo, the senior of the Romeo brothers, has been playing with the two in various bands for years, but this latest incarnation, dubbed Gameday Regulars (which they named for their love of sports), started in January 2011. Regarding the meaning behind the name the band states, "We are big sports fans, we are Gameday regulars." 2011 has been a busy year for the band and will prove to continue to be so. "The whole process of creating this record was truly an amazing experience from start to finish. We believe that we captured exactly what we wanted," says Will Romeo, "the essence of Gameday Regulars."				</description>

            Look how tight that photo is. Here we see Washington DC's GIVE, hair, and Bold, Catherine Wheel, and Lionel Richie shirts- it almost says it all. What you don't see is the self released/self titled LP, fanclub &amp; Heartworm Press cassettes, and five 7" singles released on such labels as Triple B, Youngblood, React!, Painkiller, and Deranged - all within the past four years.  GIVE began in 2009 as a five piece based out of the DC/Baltimore area, playing across the US and Europe. Making music that grows with every release, embracing their pasts while taking an important leap into the future. In this time they have won the affection and respect of kids worldwide while returning the love by inviting fans turned friends to become part of the Flowerhead way of life. Total fucking Flowerhead.  And that says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Good Luck is, without hesitation, the most positive group of people in one band possible. This exuberant wellspring is tapped on each and every song, even the heartfelt and downtrodden ones. In any other hands, the noodling would be too noodley. The sugar would be too delicious. Somehow the intricacy and curious time signatures melt away, taking a back seat to the overtly catchy and triumphant choruses. Charmingly humble and possessing a wickedly sharp wit, these songs are as fine as they come. This band deserves to be massive, thought they would probably be just as happy opening for Ted Leo on a world tour.				</description>

            Good Riddance is a hardcore punk band from Santa Cruz, California which was formed in the early 1990s. The band grew out of California's vibrant surfing and skateboarding culture and was influenced by such bands as Black Flag, The Adolescents, TSOL and Bad Religion as well as East Coast bands like Sick Of It All and the Cro Mags.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The group's early years were spent going through line up changes, playing local and regional shows and recording demos as they developed their sound. Early tours and a 7" record release on Little Deputy Records in 1993 ("Gidget") brought the band widespread interest and overwhelmingly positive reviews. In 1994 the band caught the interest of Fat Wreck Chords who released the "Decoy" 7" later that year while the band hit the studio with producer Ryan Greene to record their first full length album "For God And Country" which was released in early 1995.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Over the next decade Good Riddance went on to release seven full length albums and an EP for Fat while crisscrossing the globe dozens of times on tour. The band developed a dedicated and passionate fan base through their constant touring and politically charged music. Good Riddance began donating a portion of their record sales to various organizations and doing whatever they could to raise awareness about the causes they felt strongly about.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In May 2007 Good Riddance played their final show, fittingly in their hometown of Santa Cruz. The members then went their separate ways to raise families and pursue careers. Though there have been numerous offers to reform and play in the five years since, the band has turned them all down.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 2012 the members of Good Riddance decided to get together and play a few shows again. The reason was simple: they missed the songs. The group has no immediate plans for any further releases at this point but is looking forward to reuniting on stage and celebrating the memorable material they have longed to play and which their loyal fans have been waiting to hear once again.				</description>

            Nineteen years ago a Samurai, a Limey, a Mutt and a Cyborg oddly enough decided to make music together. Sadly, after a decade of alien conspiracies, tragic loss of expensive bread and living the lavish life of sleeping in parking lots, one by one they drifted away from what brought them together and they disbanded.        &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            With the dark days beneath their Zamboni wheels, they have decided to once again to join one another on stage. It will be the first time Grade has performed in the US in eleven years and will feature their 7th drummer, a man with missing fingers and the uncanny ability to know the songs  better than the original four that wrote them.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            For those of you who do not know Grade you are better off buying Slayer and Pixies records but those of you who need a good dose of nostalgia, they are ready to deliver their schizophrenic brand of horrible melodic hardcore. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            XOXO, see you in the pit!!!				</description>

        <description>
            Since 2007, Greenland is Melting have put their own spin on folk, bluegrass and punk; penning an original sound with straightforward, hometown lyrics. Armed with a banjo, acoustic guitar, standup bass, electric guitar and a suitcase bass drum in tow, the Greenland boys break the typecast we all know as the "Gainesville sound" and bring a breath of fresh, folk-induced air to the masses. 				</description>

        <description>
            Progressing on their sophomore follow-up album to their 2010 Epitaph debut, Until We Surrender, Heartsounds reach a new level of maturity and diversity without holding back a single ounce of what fans have loved from the start, and that is pure punk rock heart. Drifter embraces their same fast, melodic, technical punk rock style that we have come to love, while reaching new heights vocally and in overall songwriting. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Now consisting of four solid members, including founding members Laura Nichol (guitars/vocals) and Ben Murray (guitars/vocals), Heartsounds have added two new permanent members Trey Derbes (Drums) and Kyle Camarillo (Bass). Drifter was recorded over a two month period beginning in February 2011 and the band have once again tapped Zack Ohren to helm producing duties along with the help of Epitaph founder and Bad Religion member Brett Gurewitz.  Drifter is fast, modern, melodic punk with many different influences evident within the record including hints of 80's bands like Queen and Fleetwood Mac while keeping the intensity of 90's era punk. "The songs are more thought-out, more riff-driven, and definitely more complex" says, Ben Murray.  Title track, "Drifter" highlights the themes of the album lyrically and musically with catchy chorus hooks and fast rhythms, making it the "pop punk" anthem of the album. "Elements" takes on the darker side with melodic riffs and has a guest vocal appearance by Jason Cruz from STRUNG OUT. "Nothing Happens for a Reason," the album closer, is an song about coming to grips with losing someone close, which sums up the melancholy tones of the record.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "This record has been two years in the making, and means so much to all four of us in Heartsounds. I think that any fans of punk rock, hardcore, or heavy metal will find something to enjoy within the 12 tracks of Drifter," says Murray. "We know our fans will be headbanging and singing along to this record in no time. We hope you are all as excited as we are!"				</description>

        <description>
            Although heavily influenced by Indie Rock, Heartwell are native Punks that harness the energy of the iconic punk bands they grew up on. With lyrics that focus on the aggravation and the inevitability of life. Throughout Heartwells lyrics you'll find messages that express a desire to define the anxiety of growing up and the freedom of self-reliance. Musically, Heartwell fills in the gaps of their punk undertones with melodies of jangly Indie Rock. Adopting the same sincerity of the '90s Emo scene, Heartwell creates a sound that conjures up the nostalgia of those times.				</description>

            High Dive is Toby Foster, Ryan Woods (Defiance, Ohio/Pink Houses), and Nick Romy. We play energetic, queer-positive pop-punk. Or maybe it's powerpop? Either way, it's short, fast, catchy songs about good and bad relationships and surviving despite a culture that sometimes doesn't want you to.				</description>

        <description>
            Hailing from a place like Orlando--a haven for superficiallity and manufactured feelings--ought to be a steel trap for creativity in the minds of most people, but that's hardly the case with How Dare You. Since 2007, there four guys have been evading the bullshit that surrounds them, fostering a fierce DIY aesthetic within a scene where everyone else seems to be seeking a handout or a free ride.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Their weapons of choice--soaring melodies, unique guitar interplay, two dynamic vocalists, a pounding rhythm section, direct lyrics--create a sound that's anthemic and familliar, but one that comes from a unique voice. It's punk rock that's highly evoled, but without the pretentious crap that usually qualifies such a description. These attributes are augmented tenfoldduring the band's live show, where How Dare You's passion becomes more palpable than ever amongst the clouds of smoke and pools of sweat. Their new album "The king, the clown, and the colonel" is the product of the band's experiences; whether it's staying positive while entrenched in the unhappiest place on Earth, working long hours at thankless jobs or witnessing the hypocrisy that exists within the punk scene first hand, How Dare You is fighting back.				</description>

            Hailing from the streets of Brooklyn, HULL has yet again emerged with a creation to outlive the ages. Hard at work since the release of their debut album, "Sole Lord," in 2009, ideas were envisioned and the mighty wind of creativity brought upon this Earth the latest saga, "Beyond The Lightless Sky".&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Digging further into the past, the Mayan epic takes the listener through a division of two brothers and the struggles that they are faced with. One finds salvation amongst the stars and the wisdom of a stranger, while the other is mesmerized with the bloodthirsty belief of sacrifice and self mutilation. In silence lies a realm that exists outside the plane of fear.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Taking the new songs on the road, HULL embarked on a successful mission to Austin for the SXSW festival to then triumphantly return and join forces with longtime friend and talented engineer/percussionist, Brett Romnes (IATA). Within an enormous, darkened club, many nights fell into morning as the immense sound was captured for the album, then finally putting the recording into the hands of a mixing madman, Billy Anderson. With such experience as The Melvins, Neurosis and Eyehategod, the journey was brutally finished.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Known to behold vast sound expanses, HULL maximizes harmony and tone within one monstrous palate. Upon your brow, focus, as a furious whip of intermingling guitars propel you through the atmosphere as a low pulse resonates through your entire being while the pounding drums blanket all chasms of reality. Find yourself immersed in a musical tide as it is played out before your ears beyond the lightless sky.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            HULL materializes as a massive entity storming stages and immersing their audiences in a blanket of grandiose down-tuned compositions. A shifting fault line of decibel heavy harmony, this collective force converges in a collision of thrash, doom, classic rock, and formal orchestral works. HULL commands their listeners through each riff with incredible precision, as a seafarer guides vessels through ominous waters. Submerged in cosmic soundscapes, HULL challenges the mind with flowing, off-time fugues and powerful, dynamic movements. Brace yourself for an onslaught of eruptive force as a new world of music is formed in the deafening clap of thunder that is HULL.				</description>

            Featuring ex-members of Victor! Fix the Sun and Cloudmouth, the three piece packs a bigger punch than most bands twice their size. For fans of early Funeral Diner and Raein, the band's sound more so strikes your ears with a broad, blunt force a la Coalesce's fury.				</description>

            After an EP on Black Pint, a 7" on Square Up, and a split with O Pioneers!!! on Kiss of Death, Junior Battles released their first full-length record with Paper + Plastick, toured, and towed their first van to the wreckers. They grew up, becoming deep-voiced lumberjacks with Molson Canadian for blood. They learned what it meant to be men with calloused hands and cigarette burns on their arms, chopping wood to heat their cast iron stoves that they might heat their homes and lightly char the bison meat of which their families would feast. They disappeared into the tundra and emerged as battle-scared warriors of the night. Fashioning from discarded timber the tools of their trade, they still play pop-punk. Go figure.				</description>

        <description>
            Karbomb is a 4 piece punk rock band from Athens Ga. Starting in 2005 as a straight forward fast, sloppy, joke band, the sound has evolved over the years to more of a technical and melodic beast. If you take the speed and technicality of bands like Nofx and Lagwagon, stir in the powerful melodies of Face to Face, and top it off with the vocal hostility of acts like Hot Water Music or American steel, you get KarbomB; a delightful Irish beverage or a kamakaze killer, you be the judge. With lead vocals coming from the drummer, and a balls-out stage show, KarbomB separates themselves from the average punk rock band. They've played many shows in and around the state of GA with such names as Alkaline Trio, The Queers, Screeching Weasel, Guttermouth, Down By Law, The Spears, Worn in Red, The Bastard Suns, and many more.... Karbomb is made up of 4 hard working individuals with no plans to quit or slow down.				</description>

            Kite Party is a band of 5 ex-astronauts seeking fame and fortune in the high-spirited modern music industry. The band released a full-length record in 2011, titled "Baseball Season," and is currently beginning work on another release. They have slumped their way through several tours, and just in case you were wondering, their answer is "yes."   				</description>

            Goleta, California's Lagwagon first burst on the scene way back in 1988 playing a unique brand of speedy, highly technical pop-punk that made them one of the most influential punk bands of the 90's. The first band ever signed to Fat Wreck Chords and the definitive act on the label, Lagwagon were pioneers in creating the now-famous "Fat Wreck sound" with their speedy drums, guitar virtuosity and undeniable melodies. They've influenced hundreds of thousands of kids, been around the world more times than Ferdinand Magellan and twisted and redefined themselves over the course of a career that spans almost twenty-five years. Now, Fat Wreck Chords has decided to take Lagwagon's five classic full lengths from the 90's, (92's Duh, 94's Trashed, 95's Hoss, 97's Double Plaidinum and 98's Let's Talk About Feelings) and give them the truly classy update they deserve. Get stoked because on November 22, Lagwagon is releasing five of the coolest gifts a band has ever given their fans. These 5 reissues are destined to redefine what constitutes a truly awesome redux.				</description>

            Musical anthropologists interested in the study of just how fast a band can evolve need look no further than the six upright, upstanding men in Oregon's Larry and His Flask. Formed by brothers Jamin and Jesse Marshall in 2003, the Flask (as the band's expanding army of fans calls them) spent its first half-decade stuck in a primordial, punk-rock goop, where a blood-sweat-and-beers live show took priority over things like notes and melodies. Don't misunderstand: The band was (somewhat) skilled and an absolute joy to watch, but the goal was always the party over perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Over the past two years, however, Larry and His Flask has gone from crawl to sprint at breakneck speed. First, Jamin Marshall moved from gargling-nails vocals to drums. Guitarist Ian Cook became the band's primary voice. And a trio of talented pickers and singers - Dallin Bulkley (guitars), Kirk Skatvold (mandolin) and Andrew Carew (banjo) - joined the family. (And no, you didn't miss something. No one is named Larry.)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Determined to make music for a living or die trying, the six brothers set out in a van, intent on playing for anyone, anywhere at any time. From coffee shops to dive bars and street corners to theater stages, the Flask honed their sound and show through experience, attacking each gig like buskers who must grab and hold the attention of passersby in hopes of collecting enough change to get to the next town.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            By 2009, Larry and His Flask's train began gaining steam. The band's new songs are a blurry blend of lightning fast string-band picking, gorgeous nods to old-school country, and sublime multi-part harmonies, all presented through a prism of punk chaos. The boys have grown and changed, yes, but their shows are still gloriously physical displays of live music's sheer power. In other words, keep your eyes peeled, or risk taking the heavy end of Jesse Marshall's flailing, stand-up bass right between the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            A slot supporting the Dropkick Murphys in the Flask's hometown led to an invitation to open for the Celtic punk kingpins across the eastern half of the United States, as well as an opportunity to finally record their new, twangier sound. The result is Larry and His Flask's three-song, self-titled 7" record, pressed in a limited run that's quickly being snapped up by the band's new fans, who've been clamoring for a sip of aural hooch to call their own.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In mid-2010, the Flask is holed up in their crash pad in Central Oregon, working on songs for their first full-length, playing gigs here and there, and, in the words of Jesse Marshall, "fixing the van and all our broken shit"Â in anticipation of the next leg of a lifelong tour. Keep up with the band's never-ending tour schedule at www.larryandhisflask.com&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            LATTERMAN hail from the annals of Long Island's suburban, cultish, punk/hardcore/emo history. Born into the hands of teenagers, LATTERMAN was a band from 2000-2006 who toured all the fuck over the place and mostly played (too loudly) to sparse rooms. Taking heartfelt bites, often awkwardly, out of hard subjects like feminism/dismantling patriarchy as men and keeping corporate influence out of DIY,  they were a voice for equality in an overly homogenous scene. These reverberations can be seen today in countless ripoffs of their playing style and hopeful lyricism. LATTERMAN was one of the few bands at the time who both spoke out on political subjects AND played catchy, melodic punk rock. LATTERMAN donated $1000 from their East Coast reunion shows last winter to Olympia, WA's Queer Rock Camp where Matt is a volunteer. The members have all gone down different and better paths with their music and bands, though their influences are easily traceable to their shared origin in DIY punk. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Laura Stevenson was schooled in the traditional music of her grandfather and grandmother (composer of "The Little Drummer Boy" and vocalist for the Benny Goodman Orchestra respectively) from an early age. It wasn't until she started performing with Bomb The Music Industry in her teens, that she began writing on her own. Privately crafting songs on the softer side of indie rock and traditional folk, Stevenson was soon tapped as the band's opener and, with the addition of Mike Campbell and Alex Billig in 2007, Laura Stevenson and the Cans solidified. Their live band grew into a quintet, often times swelling to eight members, and the following debut LP, A Record, won them fans far and wide having been downloaded over 25,000 times since it's 2008 release.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band's 2011 release, Sit Resist, is an album centered around never sitting stagnant, and sees a matured band that has been continuously at work writing, arranging and touring for the past three years. Lyrically, Stevenson's pen has a sharp, poetic tone, making it impossible not to be taken in by her stories. Where A Record crackled with Stevenson's intimate voice alongside gentle acoustics, begging the listener nearer, Sit Resist commands the attention of all within earshot with its rich instrumentation and textured melodies. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The album graced several Best Of 2011 lists, including PunkNews.org's staff and reader lists, the Onion A.V. Club, Sputnik Music, and The Ruckus.				</description>

        <description>
            Lemuria's sweet sounding post-punk with pop sensibilities is unlike anything out there right now and for that reason, along with the band's stellar and hard-working track record, is why Bridge Nine Records is excited to welcome them to the roster. Label owner Chris Wrenn said, "It's important for us to have a diverse roster of artists and we feel like Lemuria compliments a lot of our other bands while standing strong on their own accord. We've had Get Better in rotation in the office here for a while and after adding two hardcore bands to our roster, Mother of Mercy and Foundation, we decided to change it up a bit and sign Lemuria. I think our roster really mirrors our collective musical tastes and it's always exciting to expand on the types of music we release." Formed in the summer of 2004, Buffalo's Lemuria has garnered quite a bit of attention thus far in their career. The band has released a myriad of splits and 7"s (drummer Alex Kerns runs the label Art Of The Underground) and one full-length LP, Get Better, on Asian Man Records in 2008 that Punknews.org called the best debut full-length of the year. This July, Lemuria will hit the studio with producer J Robbins at the Magpie Cage in Baltimore, MD (Hey Mercedes, The Promise Ring, Jawbreaker) to record their yet-to-be-titled Bridge Nine debut. Drummer Alex Kerns said, "We are so proud to announce that Bridge Nine will be releasing our second full-length album. B9 is a family of great bands and great people and we are honored to be welcomed aboard. We can't wait to get started recording this July with J Robbins from Jawbox right after we wrap up a full US tour." Collapse 				</description>

            From upstairs you can hear two dog fighting guitars, feel floor shaking bass and see the shelves shiver with each metronomic beat complimented with three distinct voices almost lost somewhere between the amps and the floor boards, but that is from upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Underground, you'll see a precise, focused, well-determined, American Rock and Roll band. These Jersey boys haven't fallen far from the well-celebrated New Brunswick family tree of musicians and have continued their growth after a series east coast and midwest tours and their fourth release. LET ME RUN is a self-reliant, no bullshit, plug in and play, fun, hit-you-smack-in-the-face kind of band.				</description>

        <description>
            Technically, Lowtalker started in 2008 when Casey, Stu and Matt started writing songs together. But between being scattered all over the country and touring with other bands, it took them until 2010 to record their first EP "People Worry About Everything"Â in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Since the the release of "People Worry About Everything"Â Lowtalker has toured North America and continued to develop as musicians and songwriters. The distance between members makes a typical schedule impossible, but hasn't stopped the constant writing and collaboration that defined the band in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Lowtalker is a band based on the idea of making music with your friends and letting everything else sort itself out. Their music builds on the foundations of the punk and hardcore bands that the members grew up with, while contributing in its own way. What started as a side project from their day jobs (Comeback Kid, Misery Signals, Living with Lions etc.) has become it's band with an identity and life of its own. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In May, Lowtalker will enter the studio to record what will be the follow up to "People Worry About Everything"Â and their first release on No Sleep. 				</description>

            Ma Jolie is a band from Philadelphia in the vein of Superchunk, Samiam and shit that sounds like that . With members who have all been in multiple active bands, they put together a collection of songs that bring to mind the best of the late 90s punk world. Combining tight, fun rhythms, clever guitar hooks, and catchy vocals, they recently recorded their first record at the Headroom Studio in Philly. They are looking forward to releasing the record soon, but for now, the entire record is available for download on their Bandcamp page: http://majolie.bandcamp.com/.				</description>

            ooh la la, oui oui, MALADROIT are French ! Started almost like a joke they played more than 100 shows the last 3 years and released two 7", one album and a split 7" with The Sainte Catherines. The song structures are simple as fuck, the choruses sticky like a "pomme d'amour" and the guitar solos, played with one finger... almost annoying. They sing about their loser experiences with girls, life on the road and DIY punk scene, sometimes in french so no one gets it, but you know... c'est la vie !				</description>

        <description>
            Mark McCabe is a singer/songwriter from Aberdeen, Scotland.   UK Folk stalwart and writer Chris T-T describes his music as, "ÃÅMelancholic, witty and moving acoustic songs from Aberdeen's rising star who faced impending fame in Scotland by running away to Paris."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Having recently returned from Paris he likes to think he is no longer running away. He is however taking a leaf out the book called 'hard working musicians' and will spending this year following in the footsteps of his favourite artists by touring almost constantly while also finding time to write and record his new album. This allows him to avoid getting a proper job and satisfy his parents that he isn't lazy. It's a win win situation.				</description>

            Masked Intruder have been beaten up, shot at, stabbed at, arrested, falsely convicted and heartbroken so many times all they can do is write and perform pop punk about it.  Mostly love songs, mostly creepy, always a good time.				</description>

            The Ramones have probably surpassed the Beatles as the most imitated band on the planet. Mean Jeans began as a tribute to Ramones ripoff bands, but the Portland, Ore., outfitâs debut album, Are You Serious? (Dirtnap), sounds like these guys sneaked into Hollywood Forever Cemetery and smoked the ashes of Johnny and Dee Dee. A million bands go for this formula and fail, but Mean Jeans seem to have been injecting and snorting the formula for years.				</description>

            Former membres of The Sainte Catherines &amp; Yesterday's Ring write songs together and play them with friends and people they like. They also play Sainte Catherines and Yesterday's Ring songs if you ask them ( ie:offer them a shot of vodka/pickle ). Inspired by Steve Earle, The Pogues, Crass, Roxette, Leatherface and the stuff that happened in the backstage room at Poison shows in the 80s.				</description>

            Mixtapes is a band who enjoys playing songs that they write together. Sometimes they have 3 chords and occasionally can go up to 6. Words used to describe Mixtapes are very often "professionalism" , "elitist", "egotistical", and "more overrated than the gaslight anthem" by someone on punknews.				</description>

            Money/ Paper/ Hearts just want you to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            They do things to you. But you have to give them time. One listen isn't enough. Enough to seep into your skin. It might strike a nerve, but this band doesn't feel like striking anything. Only a full blown attack will do.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            While raised on and influenced by punk and post-punk rock bands like the Clash, Jawbreaker, Hot Water Music, and The Replacements, M/P/H have taken their musical ambitions and churned out honest, raw and powerfully catchy music.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            This Brooklyn band self-recorded, produced and released their debut EP in 2008. It was all done in a tiny practice space with a laptop and a few microphones in the DIY style they all grew up admiring. They went on to open for the likes of I Am The Avalanche, Banquets, and Nightmares For a Week to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            MPHÃ¢â¬â¢s latest endeavor, entitled Let Me Panic, is a sonic journey if youÃ¢â¬â¢re willing to sit down and let it digest. Let Me Panic is thick in sound, and meant to be heard at full volume. Songs like Bobbi &amp; Debbie, Making Love to a Matador, and Sonic Spill are political observations. Whereas songs like I-75, Greasy Thumb, and Wet Cement are as much an outward looking social commentary as they are an inward facing emotional assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            If you listen hard enough, you can hear the struggle of a boy becoming a man; trying to find his place in this current culture of political and economic unrest in America.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Let Me Panic!				</description>

        <description>
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "What is in a name?" The members of Mustard Plug must have considered this when they casually came up with the title of what seemed at the time to be a short-lived distraction.  While also considering the equally ridiculous "Wanker Daddies," "Shrinky Dinks," and "Cookie Puss," it was the title "Mustard Plug" that was chosen as the masthead to carry forth in the band's crusade to bring ska-punk to their humble abode of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Twenty years, 1500 shows and 200,000 album sales later, it can not be denied that the band has surpassed all expectations and permanently staked their claim in contemporary music.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Mustard Plug started out in the punk clubs, basements and dive bars of the Midwest, playing punk influenced ska music during a time most people in the U.S. had never even heard of ska.  They clung to a DIY work ethic that had been ingrained in them from growing up in the 1980's hardcore punk scene and applied it to everything they'd do for the next 20 years.  They released their first cassette tape themselves (1992's Skapocalypse Now!), and played constantly to earn enough money to record their first cd.  1994's Big Daddy Mulititude was released on legendary NYC label Moon Records and with their new found national distribution and exposure, the band climbed into their van and performed their music to new fans across North America.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 1996 the band went to the Blasting Room in Ft. Collins, Colorado to record their second cd with their hero, punk legend Bill Stevenson, who at that time had been mainly known as the drummer for the Descendents and Black Flag.  This album, Evildoers Beware, was quickly picked up by the then up and coming L.A. punk label, Hopeless Records, and released just as ska-punk music was finally gaining mainstream exposure in the U.S.   Evildoers Beware exposed the band to a broader fan base, outside their midwest roots and the international ska die-hards who had thus far rallied around the band.  The late 90's became a blur as they hit the road, playing 150 shows a year and opening tours for the likes of Face to Face, The Bouncing Souls, Hepcat, MXPX, Less Than Jake, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 1997, the band recorded their version of the Verve Pipe's "The Freshmen" for a local radio compilation.  Their version infused ska-punk energy in to a top 40 pop classic and immediately got picked up by several large commercial radio stations coast to coast and became a fan favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band's momentum continued to grow, allowing them to headline tours throughout North American and eventually Europe, Japan, and Brazil, and play to huge crowds at seminal clubs like CBGB's in NYC, the Metro in Chicago, Emo's in Austin and The Whiskey in L.A.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Towards the end of the 90's the band returned to the Blasting Room to record the critically acclaimed Pray For Mojo and continued to hit the road constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            At the beginning of the new millennium, the band continued their mission of bringing their music to the masses.  Despite ska music's fall from grace, the band returned to their grass roots base and continued to tour. In 2003, they released the ska-punk gem Yellow #5, this time going to Detroit to self produce and record it.  In 2004 the band turned the public's perception of ska on it's head by co-headling the initial run of the Ska Is Dead Tour, playing in front of packed concert halls from coast to coast.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 2007, the band returned to the Blasting Room to record In Black and White.  The album was hailed by many as a return to form, while creating a modern take on the ska-punk genre.  Since then the band has continued to tour internationally and write new songs.  Several new singles have been released including split 7 inches with Bomb the Music Industry and Montreal's The Beatdown.  During the past year, the band has continued to hit the road, including a tour of Europe that saw them at Belgium's massive Groezrock Festival and conquering the 1500th show benchmark in the U.S. The band continues to write songs for an upcoming album.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            As Mustard Plug looks back over their twenty years of relentless touring and recording, they are proud of their accomplishments and see no reason to slow down.				</description>

        <description>
            Naked Raygun is a Chicago-based punk rock group. Initially active from 1980 to about 1992, Naked Raygun had several short-lived reunions afterwards and a full-time reformation in 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Following their reunion at Riot Fest 2006, Naked Raygun announced that the band was "back for good." The reunited lineup consists of its "Raygun...Naked Raygun" members: Jeff Pezzati, Bill Stephens, Pierre Kezdy, and Eric Spicer.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            From the beginning, their music had a strong sense of melody and songwriting, with Pezzati's lyrics often exploring working class issues. Naked Raygun began in the hardcore punk style, later branching out into post-hardcore territory. By their early 1990s incarnation, Naked Raygun's melodic tendencies became more pronounced, with strong power pop leanings in the vein of Buzzcocks, Stiff Little Fingers, and The Jam.				</description>

            Much like how the sand cranes of the Platte River gather every autumn in Nebraska to drink from the river and squawk in migratory camaraderie, Nato and his cohorts gather every autumn in Gainesville to drink from the river of PBR and squawk in migratory camaraderie and perform after-hours versions of songs from the album Nebraska. This is Nato's newest band, and his best yet. Hailing from Minneapolis, with a couple 7"s out already and a full album coming out this fall, the music is best described by listening to it, but if you can't get this guidebook to play, think Bruce Springsteen fronting the Exploding Hearts, maybe, or Husker Du covering Otis Redding. Since 2001, Nato's played in a bunch of bands, from the Modern Machines (back when he lived in Milwaukee), on up through his New York City-based bands the Radio Faces (with Jamie from Bent Outta Shape and Mikey Erg) and the Used Kids (with Mikey again, and Kate from Big Eyes). The last two Fests, Nato has been abducted by aliens at the end of his set, and chased offstage by a hot cop. What surprises lurk in store for Fest 11? Better catch the Blue Diamond Band's show to find out.				</description>

        <description>
            Negative Approach were formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1981. The band is considered among the pioneers of hardcore punk, particularly in the Midwest region. Like most hardcore bands, Negative Approach was little known in its day outside of its hometown. It is now idolized in the Detroit rock underground and the punk subculture, considered to be one of the elite bands of the "old school" era, and continues to be influential.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            NA's first gig was in the basement of Necros drummer Todd Swalla's mother's home. Soon after, they recorded a demo, and followed that up with an appearance on the Process of Elimination compilation 7" EP, released on Meatmen frontman Tesco Vee's fledgling Touch &amp; Go label, named after hisfanzine of the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The first proper Negative Approach studio release came in 1982 with their self-titled 7" EP, also on Touch &amp; Go. It contained "Can't Tell No One," "Ready To Fight" and "Nothing," which is considered by many to be the quintessential NA song.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The following year saw the release of the Tied Down LP, also venerated as a hardcore classic.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Negative Approach's musical style was based on Detroit proto-punk/rock &amp; roll icons The Stooges. Of The Stooges' guitarist Ron Asheton, John Brannon said, "So much of what NA stands for; our sound and lyrics were based on the music which he helped to create." NA were also influenced by high-octane British punk rock (especially Discharge) and Oi! music (Blitz, 4-Skins, et al.), although from the start their sound and demeanor were considerably more aggressive and brutal than that of their influences. NA's brand of hardcore was savage and nihilistic, exuding frustration, pessimism and rage. This was personified in the band's vocalist John Brannon, an intimidating and intense young man with a shaved head, piercing stare and belligerent attitude. His vocal style and stage presence set the standard for those that followed.				</description>

        <description>
            The story of No Trigger begins in Massachusetts in the year 2000 when the impassioned hardcore punk outfit made their first splash with a series of self-released demos and split EPs, leading punk rock media outlets such as Pastepunk and Punknews to name them the best unsigned band of their time.  Fast forward to 2006, countless live shows later, and the release of the band's landmark debut (and to this point, only) full length album, Canyoneer on Nitro Records, an album that, regardless of any future releases, cemented the band's legacy in punk rock forever.  Such is the story of No Trigger, a band destined to release groundbreaking punk rock albums, riling up their fanbase, only to disappear into the abyss and return again years later. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            That time, dear friends, is now.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            On their sophomore release "Tycoon" (due February 2012 on No Sleep Records), No Trigger have compiled what is already being considered by many to be their greatest achievement to date, and an album sure to turn the entire punk rock community on its ear, again. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Tycoon I think is right where we always wanted to be sonically." says front-man Tom Rheault.  "The vocals are a lot heavier in spots than ever before, but the choruses are catchy and we have a bunch of interesting twists. We also did a bit more experimenting with structure and parts but it's all still No Trigger. Lyrically this record is the most personal record we have ever written."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            So why the wait?  Why so long between albums?  How can a band so great at what they do make their fans wait so long for new material?  The answer is simple and all too obvious, "Life." says Rheault. "Sometimes you gotta scale back a bit and focus on other things before you can move forward with a new album, and that's what happened.  We also had a few member changes in the interim and reverted back to more or less our original lineup. It's true the last few years were pretty scarce as far as No Trigger activity goes, but a year ago we put out our Be Honest 7" and toured on it to Australia and also to Europe, which were both phenomenal tours. We also played a bunch of one off shows like Gainesville Fest and the Four Year Strong hometown holiday show and Groezrock in Belgium and such, so we've kept busy this year and plan to stay busy once Tycoon is released."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            All of which brings us to today and the band's announcement of their new album Tycoon.  Recorded in Massachusetts with Defeater guitarist Jay Maas, the album is No Trigger's most punishing and inspired material to date.  Made up of non-stop anthem after anthem, Tycoon is a pitbull off its leash, but also completely necessary, motivational, and perfect for its time.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "I can sum up what this album is to me in just one word," says Rheault, "Important."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            For fans of: Strike Anywhere, Kid Dynamite, Touche Amore&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            5 dude_ttes who unexpectedly came together in Hamburg, Germany's cold bunkers, end of 2011, on a vague mission to start something new and punk, ended up discovering that all music is pop music. Between the 5 of us, we've probably burned down enough kilometers and genres in our previous and other current haunts,from german hardcore to electro, such as Just Went Black, Matula, Tackleberry, Juri Gagarin and Talk Radio Talk, to fill sleepless nights for the rest of our...whatevers!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            So this one's all about doing what we want and love, being buddies and occasionally raising our bottles to that.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            See you down in the ville and don't forget to bring your round shoes!				</description>

            My name is PJ Bond, I live out of Sweet Pea (my 1993 Plymouth Sundance) and run around the world singing to whoever will listen.  Mostly, it's just an excuse to visit my friends, and cook grilled cheese sandwiches (seriously, I make a damn good one) and my world semi-famous spicy peanut noodles in other peoples' kitchens.  Some folks have told me I should meet Brett from The Riot Before, but based on what I've been told, he's probably a much better cook than me.  That's not to say I wouldn't like to meet him, but just that the implication that we'd get along may or may not hold water.  Well, now I've just gone and sounded rude.  Brett, if you're reading this, let's meet up for a beer and have a chat about our opinions on sous-vide cooking or how you approach your mise en place.  That sounds nice.  Anyway, I'm a decent dude, my knife skills are pretty good, and I'm happy to make you food at 3 in the morning when we're both/all drunk.  So, can I come stay at your house? 				</description>

            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The time was nineteen-ninety-something, the place was the small town of West Chester, Pennsylvania. PLOW UNITED quickly earned a place in the collective heart of punk rock for their furious melodic punk anthems that documented suburban life in a way that set them apart from their Fat Wreck and Epitaph contemporaries. They came, they made their mark, they left.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            But that's only part of the story. Fast forward to the year 2011, when the band caught their devotees by surprise when they announced that they'd be reuniting to play at the Riot Fest in Philadelphia. Defying the stigma that comes with reunions, Plow United made it immediately evident that there was nothing crass, nothing insincere about their desire to bring their signature brand of punk to a new generation. Similarly, it's clear that the creative vehicle has undergone a full tune-up and has the kind of mileage to bring them through the present tense with legitimate conviction and a new perspective entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            If the staying power of their own songs is any indicator, it's safe to say that Plow United will have no problem writing records that resonate with punks in the 21st century. Like the bands to which they were often compared (BOUNCING SOULS, NO USE FOR A NAME, LIFETIME, etc.), they have the distinctive ability to exist in any time or place and not be lost in translation. Here's to a new beginning. [Sean Morris]				</description>

        <description>
            There's no shortage of black-and-white thinking in punk rock, but let's face it: Life is a way more complicated shade of gray. It's in this gray area that Polar Bear Club have always worked best, and on their third full-length and second for Bridge Nine, Clash Battle Guilt Pride, the upstate New York quintet deliver an album that's punk in spirit but universal in appeal. Recorded with producer Brian McTernan (Hot Water Music, Circa Survive) at his Salad Days studio in Baltimore, Clash Battle Guilt Pride finds Polar Bear Club looking back on their past few years of life as a band through the bigger lens of the human experience. "I wouldn't say these are 'road songs,'" says singer Jimmy Stadt, who fronts PBC alongside guitarists Chris Browne and Nate Morris, bassist Erik Henning, and drummer Tyler Mahurin. "But we spend so much time on the road that it's impossible not to draw from that. For me, the interesting thing is how being in a band and doing the work that comes along with that can affect your life and relationships outside the band. That's where we were coming from with these songs." Formed in 2005 as a casual, part-time outlet, Polar Bear Club never expected to spend much time on the road, let alone the studio. But after mounting acclaim from fans and critics alike over 2006's The Redder, the Better EP and 2008's Sometimes Things Just Disappear, the band members eventually decided to ditch and day jobs and school commitments to make a go of it. As it turns out, some of PBC's biggest fans were running the show at Bridge Nine Records, and in 2009, the band signed to the label, hit the road for some of their largest tours to date (including a U.K. run with the Gaslight Anthem), and released their second album, Chasing Hamburg. Equally informed by the angular sprawl of early'90s post-hardcore and the gritty, whiskey-soaked sound of Gainesville, Florida, Chasing Hamburg rightfully landed PBC on Alternative Press' 2009 "Most Anticipated" list, as well as dozens of year-end lists to follow. Of course, every new album means another album cycle, and after Chasing Hamburg, Polar Bear Club hit the road hard. Tours of Europe, Australia and North America found the band sharing stages with artists as stylistically far-flung as Frank Turner, Every Time I Die and Trapped Under Ice. Summer 2010 brought a stint on the literally and figuratively blazing second half of the Vans Warped Tour. But after winding down 2010 alongside Bring Me the Horizon, August Burns Red, Emarosa and This Is Hell on the AP Fall Ball tour, PBC decided to park the van and get their bearings. "We made a conscious decision to get off the road and write," says Stadt, "because we knew we'd never have time to focus on this next record if we didn't." Six months in the making, Clash Battle Guilt Pride reflects the dedication Polar Bear Club put into writing and recording it. Notoriously perfectionist, the band arrived at Salad Days with 14 songs already in solid form, and whittled their way to an even tighter 11 with McTernan's help. "Brian truly was a sixth member," Stadt explains. "We spent weeks just 'living in' the songs with him before tracking, which gave us a lot more time to reflect. I think it also helped that he shares a lot of our musical tastes. We could talk with him about some of the bands we had in mind, stuff like Embrace, Rites of Spring, early Jimmy Eat World, and he got that we didn't want to 'do' their sound; we were more about getting inspiration from their spirit." From its slow-burning, melodically rich lead track, "Pawner," to the sprawling, reflective "I'll Never Leave New York," Clash Battle Guilt Pride is as much about anthems and choruses as it is the space between notes. The familiar, gritty 4/4 drive of past efforts is there, but it's tempered by goose-bump-inducing dynamics - as well as lyrics that make an ambiguous grab for listeners' hearts and minds. "I don't think it's fair to tell someone, 'This is what this song is about,'" Stadt explains. "When I think about the music that's most meaningful to me, I realize it's that way because of what I was able to bring to it. When someone comes up to me and says my song meant something to them, I hope it's because I gave them that same experience." Even the new album's title pulls from the same theme of giving away just enough to lure you in - something Stadt says was intentional. "Again, not to give away too much," he says, "but those four words  "Clash Battle Guilt Pride" that's what it's all about. That's life. It's complicated. It's a struggle. People will disapprove of you when you're doing things that make you happy, and you'll question yourself a lot, too. But those questions are where the interesting stuff happens. That's how you grow."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            "If I were to make a list of the twenty most important singer/songwriters of our time, Jon Konrad Wert, better known under the moniker Possessed by Paul James, would undoubtedly be among those at the very top, if not the topmost artist."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

        <description>
            Pure Graft met after an encounter on the set of ABC's "Home Improvement" where Hub was playing Tim Allen playing Tim Taylor and Lesta was playing Richard Karn playing Al Borland. After Lesta (Al) had told Hub (Tim) to be careful and told him the virtues of a "safety first" approach, Hub (Tim) simply roared "MORE POWER!" and attacked a live power cable with a souped up chainsaw.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The ensuing explosion left them both severely brain damaged and destroyed anysemblance of taste that they had previously had. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            There new found love of shoddy punk rock was embraced and after recruiting more of the more easily influenced cast members, Ben (Wilson, the neighbour), Dave (Jill, the wife) and Mcaz (all of those annoying long haired hippy kids) Pure Graft was born. To this day they follow the mantra of "MORE POWER" and constantly find themselves in new and ever more exciting, dangerous situations.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            When not narrowly avoiding death, Pure Graft can be found drinking in old man pubs around Newcastle, England, cursing ABC for cancelling their show and wishing they could remember when they were the boss of Pamela Anderson.				</description>

            Four dudes form a club that is devoted to monsters, but soon get more than they bargained for when Count Dracula adjourns to Earth, accompanied by Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, the Mummy, and the Gill Man. The uglies are in search of a powerful amulet that will grant them power to rule the world. Our heroes - Red City Radio are the only ones daring to stand in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            12-year-old Paul Pendley and his best friend Garrett Dale are die hard monster fanatics. Along with their friend Jonathan Knight (nicknamed Jo Jo), junior high tough guy Dallas Tidwell, and Paul's kid sister, merch guy and TM extraordinaire Mitchell "Merch" Vires, they come together to protect the world from the forces of evil and drink all your beer. Word.				</description>

        <description>
            Reverse the Curse hails from the small town of Hiram, OH, where the three first started playing in sixth grade. Still practicing in the same basement they formed in, Ed Starcher (vocals, guitar), Connor Johnson (bass, vocals), and Joey Regets (drums) have created their most cohesive, powerful, and meaningful material to date with their upcoming Paper + Plastick full-length debut.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Hither &amp; Yon" is slated for a July 2011 release. Recorded in the fall of 2010 with Eric Cronstein in Columbus, OH, this full length follows their 2009 "Paths" EP (recorded in 2008, a week after they graduated from high school, released by Lock and Key Collective). Whereas many bands call it quits after graduating, Reverse the Curse held together, toured incessantly, and unashamedly created honest and driven music that's as powerful as it is fresh. Haunting and infectious, slow churning yet commanding swells intertwine with ghostly tones to deliver an immeasurably memorable record.				</description>

            We're folk band (at least as an idiom) hailing from Columbus, Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Last, the debut full-length from Saintseneca, is a culmination of their cultivated and tangled garland of friendship and musical ardor. Prepped by lifelong friendships rooted in the same small Appalachian town, two successful EPs and four years of anywhere-and-everywhere-we-can-stomp touring, this record is a long time coming for the Columbus band.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band's first studio release features subtle and purposeful experimentation, building a fullness of sound previously elusive.  It is at times raucous, tender and anthemic. Intricacies aside, Last makes sure to highlight Saintseneca's singular folk sound of laconic singalongs, speed-strummed mountain dulcimers and tambourine-filled trash cans.				</description>

            "Shores will pull you into a wintry, slowpaced haze and crescendos rising from the tinkling intros envelop you in a haunting, yet calming musical blanket. Shores make it all sound so effortless: subtle melodies twist their way around carved out guitar lines and prominent drums. It's clean without being over-produced and offers dark and moody vibes, strung along by the constant promise of a climactic finale. Very much compelling, charming, subdued, delicate and mesmerising..." - Rock Sound Magazine 				</description>

        <description>
            Rarely do you come across a young band that startles you with such inherent quality. While Cleveland, Ohio's Signals Midwest might be rooted in the ethos of punk rock the band quickly transcends the tag both musically and lyrically on their sophomore album, Latitudes &amp; Longitudes. Paying tribute to the continual growth of legends like Small Brown Bike and Fairweather while echoing modern bands such as Balance And Composure and The Menzingers, Signals Midwest provide a unique perspective that resides firmly outside the punk-by-the-numbers formula.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Signals Midwest formed in late 2008 as a trio and issued their first full-length album in 2009. In 2010 the band expanded to a quartet with the addition of a second guitar player. That would be a pivotal move in the band's collaborative development. Experimenting with and expanding their sound, Signals Midwest quickly outgrew the standard pop/punk pace. With 2011's Latitudes &amp; Longitudes there is a fleshed out maturity that shines through. Recorded mostly live, the album bristles with the kind of energy and purpose that emanates from a band confidently growing comfortable in their own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Latitudes &amp; Longitudes is a powerful album full of depth and intelligence. It is an album that hits as deep and as personal as a singer/songwriter record but encompasses so much more. It is about the distance between the living and the dead, between loved ones in different parts of the world, the distance between how people spend their days vs. what they truly want to be doing and the distance between what we say and what we mean. As Thoreau said, "Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance; they make the latitudes and longitudes." Signals Midwest provides the musical journey that covers the distance and space between us all.				</description>

            Pictures of a Floating World, Silver Snakes debut released in August of 2011, is a tribute to free thinking - focusing on societal themes and individuality. It showcases glimpses of rock experimentalists At the Drive In and Fugazi, both major influences on the Snakes' sound. "Steve and Roger have been good friends of ours for a while. We had always planned to do the record with them since they understood what we were going for in making a 90s influenced, raw rock record," says Alex on working with Steve Choi and Roger Camero. The album touches on several genres, while not overstaying its welcome in any particular one.				</description>

            Four Beethovens hatched from raptor eggs and were fed a heavy diet of Long Island punk and hardcore. The result is Sister Kisser, a couple of zany brains making music from the heart. Though familiar in nature, Sister Kisser have crafted their own brand of melodic, DIY punk rock.				</description>

            Snakehealers is the brainchild of Devon Stuart Vlasin and Chad Smith, both formerly of Gainesville's outlaw country band The Takers. After the The Takers called it quits in late 2010, the two continued writing and sharing songs in Chad's shaky, second-story apartment in Gainesville's "student ghetto."Â Once they polished enough of those CTJ's, "certified tyte jams"Â, they decided it was time to add the pieces needed to create the entire vision. They were determined to be decisively particular in their selections as to not return to the pigeonholed pitfall that they were running from. The drummer was predetermined during a tour with Gainesville's own Liquid Limbs. Devon and Limb's drummer Chase Permann outlasted, ie outdrank, everyone else at an after party following a show in Athens and amongst a dune of soulless beer cans Devon asked Chase to be the drummer for his never produced solo album. Almost a year later the three began practicing at Chase's band room at The Junkyard, a DIY spot and Chase's residence, in eastside Gainesville. After a month of bass-less jam sessions it was time to fill the void. A list of potential pickers was formed and narrowed down based upon a basic set of guidelines: has to be a finger player, has to be able to sing back-ups, has to be able to hang, and has to be in no more than one other band. The list failed. A name kept coming up during the search, so they decided to go check out the guy's band and bust a hang with him. He was relatively unfamiliar to all of them, but after the show and a little bar stool banter they invited him to the next practice. Mike Alligood was asked to join the band by the end of that practice. With the chessboard set up, the songs were played to an exponential degree. The collective idea was to not play a show until the songs were worked out to their fullest potential, demoed, reworked and everyone was comfortable with the results. Five months passed and it was time. However, there was a slight snag in the next step, the dreaded band name. Hundreds of names were kicked around, possibly thousands. Following a Youtube marathon of videos documenting southern Pentecostals, known as snakehandlers, Devon sent a text to the other dudes with one word, Snakehandlers. The next dilemma was procured following a Google search of that word. There were 10 other bands with that name. Chad suggested a combo of snakehandlers and faith healers, and all of the problems were vanquished. Collectively, once again, it was decided to play the first couple of shows out of town to road test the set and the songs. In April of 2011, they embarked on a three day run with fellow Gainesvillians The Future Now. Returning from the run, some of the songs were reworked again and some were cut completely. The first Gainesville show was anxiously booked for May 20, 2011. It was a success and born were Snakehealers.				</description>

            FORMED AT THE TAIL END OF 2009 BY XAVIER GERMAIN AND LOUIS GUILLEMETTE, SOLIDS QUICKLY ADAPT ED THE SOUNDS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS BY INCORPORATING A 90S INDIE/GRUNGE SOUND INTO THEIR ALREADY EXPANSIVE STYLE. ORI GINALLY INTENDING ON EXPANDING THE LINEUP, SOLIDS BEGAN WRI TING SONGS FOR THEIR DEBUT EP GENERIC DOGS. SOON INTO THIS PROCESS GERMAIN AND GUILLEMETTE FOUND THAT THE DUO DYNAMIC WORKED BETTER FOR THEM, AS GERMAIN WAS FINDING WAYS TO FILL THE VOID OF BASS WITH ALTERNATE TUNING AND PEDAL WIZARDRY. THE RESULT IS A HIGHLY ORIGINAL INFUSION OF RHYTHM AND MELODY, IMPRESSIVELY LOUD FOR A TWO PIECE BUT STILL REFINED WITH ITS INFECTIOUS GUITAR MELODIES. AFTER SELF-RELEASING GENERIC DOGS ON CD, SOLIDS GARNERED REVIEWS THAT HELD THEM TO THE LIKES OF 90S PIONEERS DINOSAUR JR., SONIC YOUTH, AND SUPERCHUNK. THIS NOSTALGIC SOUND WAS SOON MANIFESTED IN THEIR LIVE SHOW, ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF MONTREAL BASED LABEL, MACHETTE RECORDS, WHO RERELEASED THE EP ON VINYL IN APRIL 2011. IN SUPPORT OF THE RELEASE, SOLIDS SET OUT TO PLAY SHOWS IN QUEBEC CITY AND TORONTO, AS WELL AS SHOWS AT POP MONTREAL AND POUZZA FEST. IN JANUARY 2011, SOLIDS ENTERED BREAKGLASS STUDIOS IN MONTREAL TO RECORD 3 NEW SONGS WITH ACCLAIMED PRODUCER JACE LASEK (BESNARD LAKES, STARS, LAND OF TALK AMONGST OTHERS)Â RELEASED ON 7" BY MACHETTE RECORDS FALL 2011. SOLIDS ARE NOW BUSY WRITING FOR THEIR DEBUT LP AND PLOTTING EAST COAST AND CANADIAN TOUR DATES.				</description>

        <description>
            SONIC AVENUES are just four Montreal kids who started riffing punk tunes in 2006, but since getting swept up in the booming punk epicentre of neighbouring Ottawa, they've been catapulted into the ranks of the best pop-punk acts in Canada! After releasing a few singles, SONIC AVENUES dropped a bomb in late 2009 with their debut LP on Ottawa's infamous Going Gaga Records. Within a few short months, the record had sold-out twice, including a European repress by Germany's fine Taken By Surprise and Sabotage Records.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Two years later, after obliterating eardrums from stages across North America and Europe, they returned home to record a crushing follow-up, âTelevision Youth,"Â for prestigious Portland-based label Dirtnap Records. Featuring more of the over-driven guitars, infectious harmonized melodies and blazing 2-3 minute songs that powered their debut, the AVES have nonetheless pushed the limits into new territories with this latest offering. In short, âTelevision Youth"Â is punkier, poppier, louder and dirtier than anything they've done before. Armed with this devastating new arsenal, as well as ambitious touring plans for 2012, SONIC AVENUES are sure to keep fists in the air for years to come.				</description>

        <description>
            Playing D.C.-styled hardcore in the vein of Dag Nasty and early End Of A Year, Richmond, VA's Springtime brims with energy and an unmistakeable old school flare. Forming in late 2011 and featuring members of Family Cat, Tiger Tail and Cheyenne, Springtime's self-released demo was released only a few months later in March 2012. The songs showcase a maturity that is striking for such a young, wet-behind-the-ears band. The tension and tenacity of Springtime is palpable as the first chords explode. The passion of early DC emocore from Rites of Spring to Dag Nasty shines through in sharp bouts of energy that emanate from the band's songs. With short bursts of melodic fury and dueling, angular guitars over gruff but enticing vocals the band never fails to keep your undivided attention at all times. Mixed with the melodic punk/hardcore of scene giants like Leatherface, Texas Is The Reason and Lifetime, Springtime pay fitting tribute to their influences at all times. But, much like End Of A Year, Spingtime confidently blaze their own path and will continue to do so this Summer when they record for their first proper release, a 7" EP to be unveiled in the Fall. 				</description>

            State Lines make quite the first impression as the first chords ring out on their sophomore release. Recorded this Winter with Sainthood Reps' Bradley Cordaro, these four songs brim with confidence and overflow with punk energy while playfully pulling at those pop heartstrings we all possess. But while State Lines have plenty of youthful spirit left over they bite deeper with lyrical depth.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Though their pop-punk forefathers are irrefutably influential, they have inspired a generation of bands that seem to steal the wrong cues and follow them towards the same predictable ends. State Lines isn't one of these bands; they've identified the spark and spirit that made their predecessors feel so initially fresh and have bottled it, choosing to express this explosive essence without following their winding, wandering path. While it is doubtful that State Lines has finished growing yet, it is refreshing they seem to know exactly where they are going.				</description>

        <description>
            Of all the various compliments Streetlight Manifesto have received from fans over the years, there is one in particular that seems to resonate most with the members of the band. After a show, a kid in torn jeans and a Pantera shirt, sporting ridiculous facial hair, will find one of the Streetlighters outside of the club and say hello, followed by "Man, I don't listen to this kind of music, in fact I hate most ska bands, but you guys are something else." Or it will be a jazz fan, sitting in the back of the venue during the set, bobbing his head, eyes closed while the band does their thing on stage. Or one of the club's stagehands will comment, while helping break down the lighting rig, that he actually enjoyed a band he was working for for once, despite having heard thousands of bands on the job over the years. And therein lies Streetlight Manifesto's appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Seven guys, seven different musical backgrounds, seven different personalities, one band, one unique and unmistakable voice. Formed four years ago in New Jersey as an ad hoc group intended to put out one album and disappear, one thing lead to another and within a few months of their debut release, Everything Goes Numb, Streetlight Manifesto were officially a full time touring band, traveling the world, spreading their infectious and energetic tunes to all who would listen. One part rock, one part ska, with influences from latin, klezmer, folk, world, funk, jazz and classical thrown in, the band redefined what most people expected from a "ska" band. Three albums later, and after countless worldwide tours, the guys are still at it, still performing live to sold out shows filled with sweat drenched fans, all dancing and singing along at the top of their lungs. And the Streetlight boys wouldn't have it any&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            other way.				</description>

            "At this point, punk rock is saturated with history spanning generations. Crafting a unique sound is no easy task; it is something that can only be done with a heart that's full of love for the history and a deep yearning to earn it's place within it. Strong City is a band full of young people with such hearts supplying the blood to highly tuned muscular-skeleton systems within some of the fastest arms in the Midwest." -servo				</description>

        <description>
            You probably know this much already: Teenage Bottlerocket (or simply "TBR" to their fans) is currently one of the hottest bands in punk rock and their new record, They Came From The Shadows, is highly-anticipated. But before we go any further you should probably know that they're from Wyoming. Crazy, huh? Although more famous for its frontier forts and characters like Butch Cassidy, the "Front Range" (as it's known to the locals) may very well be the unlikely home to the next great punk rock band. At least that's what the kids are sayin'. But don't take our word for it, even Alternative Press featured them as a "Band You Need To Know in 2009"... and they don't even have those Jennifer Aniston haircuts!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Their beginnings are as humble as they come. Three friends (two of them being identical twin brothers) wanted to start a fresh, no-bullshit punk band that defied--if not openly mocked--the corny emo groups that were pervading malls, mainstream, and MySpace. They took the spirit of Midwest bands like Alkaline Trio and Dillinger Four and added the earnest sensibilities of the Ramones. It made for such an undeniably likable combination that other bands were asking themselves, "Why didn't we think of that?" Not long after their forming, they doubled their number of vocalists and were joined by Kody, a fellow Wyoman and frontman of the beloved Lillingtons. With a solidified four-piece lineup they did a bunch of touring and two studio full lengths with Chicago label, Red Scare Industries. At this point things were happening fast for the young punks from the Cowboy State, and after playing shows with bands like the Queers, NOFX, The Falcon, and Dead To Me, they were snatched up by Fat Wreck Chords. And that's where Teenage Bottlerocket is today. Oh, if you must know the truth, the band takes it's name from an old spray-painted jalopy that used to cruise the streets of their hometown. Much of the time spent in those early days revolved around goofing off and carefree skateboarding, and that fun spirit is still reflected in their music today.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            It's only fitting then that the first song on their breakout record would be the hilarious and punchy "Skate or Die"; a snappy tune that gleefully references the Bones Brigade and JFA. This and the other songs that make up They Came From The Shadows are classic Bottlerocket, with an emphasis on fun times and hooky melodies. To further insure the album's potential, this sucker was produced at Blasting Room Studios (Rise Against, Descendents, Lemonheads, etc), so you know it sounds huge and rockin'.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            What will surely follow the release of their Fat Wreck debut is a bevy of touring. They've been to Europe multiple times, so you know they'll be back in short order; and already booked is their first tour of Japan. Also lined up is a 2-month tour of North America this Fall with Reno's Cobra Skulls playing support. That massive odyssey will take them all over the land and have them playing shows with The Lawrence Arms and Dead Milkmen. When Teenage Bottlerocket mobilizes their band, they go all out and truly bring it. Such is their approach to songwriting, live shows, recording, and even partying on tour.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Few things are more exciting than a young band with a great new record on a new label. Their booming, seemingly-sudden popularity is reminiscent of bands like Against Me! and Gaslight Anthem, so who knows what to expect next from these upstarts. If their unhinged live show is any indication, it won't be for lack of trying. So stay tuned and expect nothing but continued success from these punk rock bandits. They're certain to make Wyoming proud.				</description>

        <description>
            Irrevocably the best punk rock band to come out of Denmark. With massive appeal and unquestionable work ethics THE 20BELOWS have slowly paved their own way to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Hailling from a punk rock background that draws inspiration from bands such as The Ramones, Swinging Utters and Alkaline Trio, THE 20BELOWS combine a large variety of tempi and catchy melodies with a welcoming textual universe that underlines the very reason for the existence of the band; relevant, charming and refreshing.				</description>

            The following has been said about the Capitalist Kids: "It's easy to find a pop-punk band that can write a catchy song about a new or lost love, but when they can seamlessly flow between a song like that and a song about the growing income gap in this country, it's a really, really special thing." Singer/bass player Jeff and drummer Dugg have been playing music together since high school (a long, long time ago). They started the Capitalist Kids around 2004, and over the next few years put out a few homemade CD's and cycled through guitarists (the legendary Ben Snakepit even filled the position for a while). Finally in 2007 they acquired the incomparable Rawn of the Anchor. Having found their sound, they put out their first real studio EP, "Acceptable Boundaries" and continued playing in front of rooms of several people. With the release of 2010's "Too Big to Fail", the band solidified their place as one of the premiere irrelevant pop-punk bands of the day. Undeterred by the lack of enthusiasm, the Kids continued playing and touring, with stops at Death to False Hope Fest and Awesomefest 5, and they returned to the studio. 2012 has seen the release of the bands first 7" on Hang Up Records (the cover featuring a clever MTX tribute that Dr. Frank himself got a kick out of), and the brand new full-length LP "Lessons on Love, Sharing, &amp; Hygiene" on Toxic Pop Records. As if that weren't enough, the band recently became a 4-piece with the addition of young Braden on 2nd guitar. With a fully fleshed-out live sound and an increase in poppy backup vocals, the band is excited about more touring and even more recording in the near future.				</description>

            Such acts of violence were only the beginning for the terrifying Abdullah the Butcher, whose menacing figure, excessive violence, and complete disregard for the safety of himself or his opponents quickly established his reputation for ruthless brutality. Abdullah's matches almost always turned into bloodbaths, and he was infamous for stabbing his opponent's wounds with his trademark fork (or any other foreign weapon that he could get his hands on).				</description>

        <description>
            The Fake Boys started in 2007 not because we wanted to be in a band but because we have to be in a band. We play a warm, heavy, brand of rock and roll that places as much emphasis on unique melody and chord structure as it does being honest and mean. "Pig Factory" is the record i've been trying to write since i was 14 and it is written around the struggles of trying to be your own man in a system that wants you to do anything but that. The sounds are layered with heavy hints of 60's rock, 70's punk, 80's hardcore, and 90's alternative. Perfect for anyone who loves good, honest, rock and roll or for xmessageboardx simpletons looking to grow up a bit.				</description>

            "Formed in 2008, The Great Explainer has risen to prominence among New Jersey's underground music scene.  Smearing the lines between punk, hardcore and indie, The Great Explainer offers a progressive alternative to the typical punk rock fare.  Look forward to dual contrasting vocals, complex yet aggressive guitar work and a powerfully locked in rhythm section."				</description>

            A fashion-crust Pollack, a dude that looks like if Ben Franklin was young and handsome, a drunken 90lb weakling and a hair-farming little guy that looks like he either parties with the Beastie Boys or the Arab Spring walk into a bar. Sounds like the start of a pretty good joke right? Well, this joke calls itself the Holy Mess and chances are that it walks into a bar, breaks a bunch of things, insults a few people, angrily grumbles and then melts your dick right off your pelvis with their sloppily aggressive take on the already sloppy and aggressive pop punk sound popularized by bands like Dillinger 4 and the Lifetime. The punchline of the joke is that the Holy Mess don't give a fuck on a level so profound that when I asked them some history so I could write this bio I just got a message back that said "if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass." Yet somehow, they have managed to crank out a modern masterpiece of booze soaked, regret fueled bangers that they've foolishly titled "Cande Ru Las Degas" and even more foolishly left up to the flying monkeys over at Red Scare Industries to disseminate to the masses, and said dissemination will commence around Jume 2012 so hold onto your fancy opera glasses, grandpa. -Brendan Kelly&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Inspired by a wide array of music influences, The Hunters take the best elements of heartfelt anthemic punk rock to muddy guitar-driven blues, to spellbinding folk to thundering rock n' roll. They create a catchy, yet potent sound that they're proud to call their own. They also love pizza out of garbage cans and wear really short shorts.				</description>

            "Fine, how about you name it?"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Maybe I will, jerk."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            I was listening to The Max Levine Ensemble when I had the above conversation with a friend. Remember the first time someone told you The Dillinger Escape Plan was considered "mathcore" and your brain exploded because suddenly the world made a little more sense? Seriously, this sound has to have its own sub-sub-sub genre. The combination of music, vocal stylings, and lyrical content are unique enough to qualify for its own classification. It's catchy, it's something you love to sing along to, and it's fun. At the same time, the lyrics aren't exactly about kissing a girl or beating a brat. They'e politically charged and socially conscious in a way that's more poetic than the usual "in your face" stance political songs have a tendency to take.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            I could ask where the band is from (Washington DC), or how long they've been around (since 2000), or why they're called The Max Levine Ensemble when no one in the band is named Max Levine (fuck, dude, don't you have internet access?) but I'd much rather have everyone listen to one of their albums and ask, "What would you call this genre?"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            My current suggestion is "Intelli-Politi-Posi Punk." Too bad it's the stupidest genre name ever thought up by anyone in the history of ever. "Pop punk" is it.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            Bio:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The Motorleague are a rock and roll band from The Canadian East Coast who have persevered against van-break-ins, line-up changes, highway deer-explosions, The Rocky Mountains in December, and gasoline prices in Atlantic Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band plays catchy punk-laden rock and roll pulling influences from bands like Thin Lizzy and Turbonegro.  They are currently preparing to release their 2nd full length record which was produced by Steve Rizun (Flatliners / Creepshow / Junior Battles) and will be on the road this summer / fall.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            In the space of 3 years, Melbourne's THE SMITH STREET BAND have gone from playing house parties, storm drains and pretty much anything in between to being the 'go to' band for many international bands that have toured Australian in recent times. Fronted by loveable Melbourne song-writer Wil Wagner, their infectious sound melds high energy punk-rock, elements of 90's indie-rock and a distinct story-telling style of vocals. Their debut album 'No One Gets Lost Anymore' is out on Poison City Records and by the time you read this, album #2 will be on the way. As a band they are also partial to mock meat and mid-priced beer.				</description>

        <mp3></mp3>
        <description>
            The Snips have never been a band known for their prodigious musicianship nor are they responsible for a plethora of material but what this quintet of crazy Canucks do pride themselves on is leaving it all on stage night in and night out with an incredibly honest and sincere delivery that peers and fans alike have been forced to take note of...and also...they party. Like, drink all your liquor kinda partying. After years of fighting the good fight, the band, Ricky Pridmore, Bart Breton, Tone Ventresca, Chris Accursi and Brent Fulop have finally come into their own and hit full stride with their new full-length record "Highs Of Low".&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Two years removed from the release of 2009's "Blackouts" EP, the band have managed to completely shake things up once again in a fashion that has an all too inherent presence in The Snips camp. "Blackouts" was an EP containing big, bright, anthemic tracks like "Tired Tires" and "Black Leather Vest" which both boasted a healthy dose of Foo Fighter-ish punk that immediately becomes embedded in your mind for days. On "Highs Of Low", The Snips are aiming to catch your attention with an approach which greatly contrasts that of its predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Sonically, The Snips have definitely stepped out of the footprints of their contemporaries and relocated themselves in a much dirtier, unpolished and esoteric place and have procured the guidance of Dan Weston (City and Colour, Attack In Black, Living With Lions) to help achieve this feat. "Highs Of Low" doesn't stand in a different ballpark from "Blackouts" but does signify the band's continued growth and desire to genre-bend.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Sliding seamlessly from the garage fuzz comfort zone of "Blood Maps" to the grimy, at times white noise infused "Microscope" into the sombre, melancholy of "O' Brother" The Snips do truly take you through every peak and valley from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. With some good ol' fashioned songwriting and a complete disregard for parameters the five members of The Snips have a singular vision that they have dubbed indie-punk and can't wait to let it buck.				</description>

        <description>
            (courtesy of Creator-Destructor Records) -&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Although the individual members of THE STEREO STATE have been playing together for over 10 years, the band first formed in 2008 in Holyoke, Massachusetts as a five piece, featuring members of McClane, Defeater, and FiveAcrossTheEyes. When Mike Poulin left the band in 2009 to focus on Defeater full-time, the remaining four members of THE STEREO STATE made the decision to keep a 4 piece. Throughout the next year, the band reworked their songs and made progressions/adjustments to their sound, resulting in their debut EP "Caffeine, Beer, and Quoting Movies", which was recorded with Jay Maas in 2010, and released via Neutral Territory Recordings.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The band has been extremely busy throughout 2011, having spent the first half of the year writing their first full-length release, "Have All My Friends Gone Deaf?". Creator-Destructor Records reached out to the band around the same time, and plans quickly solidified for the release of their debut full-length. The band soon entered Black and Blue studios in New Bedford, MA in May of 2011 with producer/engineer Trevor Reilly (A Wilhelm Scream). The result is 11 tracks of emotionally hard-hitting and genuine punk rock in the vein of Samiam, Farside, and Lifetime. Trevor Reilly states: "When The Stereo State came to record with me, it really felt like a party was rolling through.ÃI could tell immediately that these four guys were the best of friends and really just had the best time with each other, and it shows in the music they create. I could tell they couldnt give less of a shit about being popular or famous, all they cared about was these songs they labored over with love. I heard flashes of Bouncing Souls, Black Train Jack and even Lifetime in these jams. The honesty of east coast punk permeating every chord and drum fill and it brought me back to when i was a kid hearing those groups for the first time. Their songs were from the heart and catchy as fuck. Such a rarity these days. I am honored they let me produce this record and I am proud that we share the same home state. Timeless energetic rock music that aims for your soul, not your wallet"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            "Have All My Friends Gone Deaf?" is sure to infuse a wave of nostalgia into fans of 90's Fat/Epitaph punk rock, as well as please fans of more mid-tempo acts like Jawbreaker and Dinosaur Jr. However, while the band doesn't hide their influences, THE STEREO STATE has succeeded in establishing a sound and presence that they can call their own: a truly refreshing and admirable quality in modern punk rock! 				</description>

            From Atlanta, GA, the WILD are a bunch of friends who love playing music and sharing in the DIY philosophy of music, art, and politics. This is what The WILD has to say about themselves...&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            We are five friends having a great time playing music together...  We all feel the best when we are traveling together and getting to see old friends, making new ones, jumping off of high things into water, and playing music every night. right now everybody lives all over the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            country.... We're from Atlanta, Lexington, Denver, Brooklyn, and Massachusetts... We write songs that are political and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            What pine magazine had to say about the WILD:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            'The celebratory storytelling and punk-folksy delivery of this four-piece makes you wonder how such clean guitars could get your body shaking so hard. The Wild are a lot of fun, and their approach, defiant in a Bob Dylan sort of way, should give kids everywhere the feeling that they can make a difference in the world, no matter how bad things get in the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            interim.'&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

        <description>
            The New Jersey indie rock band Titus Andronicus has recorded a new album, a follow-up to our 2008 (2009?) release, The Airing of Grievances. This new album, The Monitor, will see release thanks to our friends at XL Recordings on March 9th, 2010, the 148th anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, wherein the U.S.S. Monitor and the C.S.S. Virginia entered into their epic struggle off the coast of Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The Monitor is more or less a 'concept album' that is to say, it uses the American Civil War of 1861-1865 as an extended metaphor for the concerns addressed in a somewhat linear narrative. In said narrative, our hero leaves his humble birthplace of New Jersey - the oppressive and stifling qualities of which were discussed ad nauseam about one album ago - for the greener pastures of Boston, Massachusetts. His thesis - 'the enemy is everywhere'Â - is put to the ultimate test as he pontificates on the topics of regional identity, emotional anesthetization, and the heavy yoke of trying to live decently in indecent times. All the while, he is forced to wonder whether said American Civil War was truly won or lost, or even completed. Will he find the supportive environment and like-minded compatriots he dreams of? Or will he be forced to leave his newly adopted home in ideological disgrace? What does it mean to be an American in 2009 anyway? Who are our so-called 'friends' and how actually friendly are they? Is it necessary, or even a good idea, for an indie rock album to ask these sorts of questions? The Dark Knight, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and The Taming of the Shrew also are in there somewhere. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            The Monitor was recorded during August of 2009, under the watchful eye of producer and engineer Kevin McMahon (who oversaw our first album, among others), at his studio "Marcata Recording" in New Paltz, NY. The usual suspects from the world of Titus Andronicus were all in attendance, as well as an all-star cast of luminous friends (members of Ponytail, Wye Oak, Vivian Girls, Hold Steady, etc.) and a generous assortment of colorful New Paltz locals. The aforementioned Kevin McMahon also did the mixing during September and October, and Greg Calbi did the mastering (so chosen because he is the only person alive who can claim involvement in both The Chemistry of Common Life by Fucked Up and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell by Meat Loaf) in early November.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            So what does all this sound like? It has long passages of ambient drones, blazing saxophone, pianos homages to "Charlie Brown Christmas," complete marching drumlines, Thunder Tube solos, fourteen-minute Billy Bragg knock-offs, backwards liturgical pieces, bombastic country duets, garbage cans hit with tambourines, choirs of angels with bromantic faces, probably too many spoken word interludes lifted from cassette tapes, and, of course, the hissyfit punk songs and off-key warbling we have come to expect from Titus Andronicus. Did I mention that this record is sixty-fiÂve minutes long? Because that's kind of important. Through and through, it is a wholehearted and potentially ill-advised grab for some sort of imaginary brass ring, the sound of a band desperate for success and definitely unafraid of failure.

        <description>
            You're forced to live in a world where getting awesome constantly goes wrong. The neon glow of your television set guides you to reality through reality tv. The undead walk the Earth communicating to themselves through mobile headsets. Hippies in effeminate swashbuckler masks look for another reason not to work or bath. How the fuck does one eat a double xl chalupa and not get the squirts? Too many mysteries, too many responsibilities and all the more reason to give up on life and move into your mothers carriage house. Build that "dudes room" you've always dreamed about while the wife was away at work. Too Many Daves are the embodiment of that dudes room complete with gooey floors and your very own helper monkey. 				</description>

            Toys That Kill come from San Pedro, California, the city where the freeway ends, where bullets fall from the sky on the fourth of July and where Mike Watt painted the name of his hometown on his bass and everybody started calling him "Pedro."Â This is album four but year twelve of the band, and probably year twenty-something for Toys singer/guitarist and Recess Records founder Todd Congelliere, and while it wouldn't fit his genre or his personality to start chucking around words like "expert,"Â Todd and Toys have exactly figured out how to make a couple chords and a chorus timeless in a way that's old and new all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Congelliere was at the core of F.Y.P, the band he started basically with the lowest-budget drum machine and four-track recorder legally available in 1989 after sudden and intense exposure to punk by fellow skaters who'd come by to use his ramp and bring mixtapes for the boombox. ("Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, 7 Seconds, the Germs, Descendents - if it wasn't for those bands, not only would we not sound like this, I probably wouldn't be involved with music,"Â he says now. "I've always hated normal musicians and these bands were nothing like that.")&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            When he started F.Y.P, it was hardcore, but in the loosest sense: fast, pissed, aimed squarely against a world of teachers and cops and full-of-themselves idiots. But there was more going on, too: Minutemen-style wordcram and Descendents-esque melody snarled together with pitch-dark humor and strangely sentimental sarcasm, and by the summer of 2000, it was obvious that the band called F.Y.P was ready to become something else. So naturally, they did, playing the last F.Y.P show for hundreds of proud screaming weirdos in a cavernous bar in the Inland Empire and debuting the new deal at a since-bulldozed punk club in the shadow of the Port of Los Angeles the very next night. And so, the same way the Descendents changed into All, began the mighty Toys That Kill.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            If you were there, you could tell this band was everything ex-F.Y.P-ers Congelliere and Sean Cole (now twinning Congelliere on guitar and vocals) had been saving up since ever. These were gigantic songs with choruses as heart-stopping as the Clash and a rhythm section, bassist Chachi Ferrara, drummer Denis Fleps so heavy it sank further into the stage every time the drums kicked in. (This is called the "TTK thump,"Â says Congelliere.) Toys had pop songs but pop songs broken at the edges, rock 'n' roll songs but rock 'n' roll songs with all the pose and pretension dissolved away, punk songs but punk songs that weren't ever gonna burn out and crumble away. And so Toys That Kill revealed themselves as a band that could translate Thin Lizzy and the Buzzcocks, Cheap Trick and the Descendents, the Replacements and the Who and Elvis Costello and the Ramones all down to the same simple things energy, guitar and heart.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Fambly 42 comes after a six-year - not really a break, since Cole and Congelliere each were up front in their own bands and playing in friends' bands and delivering the world the Underground Railroad to Candyland, Stoned at Heart and That's Incredible!, which you should you should go grab (preferably on cassette!) as soon as you're done with this album. But Toys returns rested and ready with an album recorded in Congelliere's home-built Clown Sound studio, steady and strong on probably its most potent line-up, built around longtime drummer Jimmy, who Congelliere calls one of his best finds ever: "F.Y.P always had rotating members so I never take for granted how long we have been able to play together," he says. "Especially since it always seems new and fresh. I've never had chemistry with anyone quite like this."Â&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            And after 12 years, they've turned this into some kind of science. There's a chord change in "Nervous Rocks"Â or "Freddy And His Mother"Â that's a Toys That Kill signature, where the song bends in a way you don't expect and barrels right through the center of you. There's a beat on "V Chip"Â or "I've Been Stabbed" that just about breaks the song in half. There are those melodies on "Waltz One Million"Â and "Fambly"Â that don't ever want to go where you predict they're going to go. And there's the slow-motion grand finale of "Clap For Alaska,"Â which unravels from a barely there guitar pattern into a high-power heartbroke anthem: "I know if I come back down, they're gonna get me!"Â It's fifteen tracks but also fifteen snapshots of a band that's become the best kind of machine of four musicians who know they can trust each other, and that all they gotta do now is fight for the song. If there's a key to what Toys do so well and have done for so long, that's it: "It shouldn't be a lost concept but that's what everyone should aim for making the song work,"Â says Congelliere. "Anything else will ruin it." -Chris Ziegler				</description>

            There's probably nothing quite as punk rock as being a punk in the Middle East and Israeli miscreants Useless ID are the long standing ambassadors of Middle Eastern punk rock to the rest of the world. Armed with eighteen years of experience and a tour history that includes such out of the way spots as China, Belarus and even Siberia, these boys from Haifa City have finally found a home with long time friends Fat Wreck Chords and together they're bringing you Symptoms, the latest and greatest entry from these four desert punks on February 14th, so this year, forget the chocolates and roses and get your sweetie some good old fashioned punk rock, Middle Eastern style.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Useless ID first started in Haifa in late 1994, but they quickly recorded a demo and took off to California where they met and befriended all their punk rock heroes. It was a risky move that paid off in spades for Useless ID because for the past eighteen years they've circled the world zillions of times with bands like NOFX, the Vandals, No Use For A Name and even Die Toten Hosen, who are kind of like the punk rock U2 of Germany and definitely not from California, but you get the idea. Useless ID has been mixing it up with the coolest bands on earth for almost two decades and things are only gonna get more exciting now that Fat's gotten its chubby little fingers on the sweet jams provided by Symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            When it came time to record Symptoms, Useless ID trekked back to the States from Tel Aviv (current home town) to work at The Blasting Room Studios with the mighty Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore (Rise Against, NOFX), so you know the sound is absolutely dynamite. The end results are twelve tracks of falafel flavored Fat Wreck style jammers tinged with a little more moody introspection than Useless ID is traditionally known for. This is probably due to the fact that bassist/vocalist/songwriter Yotam listened to nothing but Husker Du while he was writing Symptoms. He even ended up with a Husker Du Tattoo by the time the dust cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Anyway, after finishing up the record, Bill Stevenson was so impressed that he hounded label honcho Fat Mike to put it out. Eventually Mike relented and gave the record a spin and well, the rest is history. Useless ID has put out records on their own Falafel Records, Kung Fu and Suburban Home but their sound and attitude have always been classic Fat Wreck. Now, Useless ID is getting ready to hit the road in support of Symptoms, and you can bet your sweet ass they'll be going everywhere that will have them. Chances are that you've never seen four crazy Israelis flailing around on a stage playing punk rock before, so check 'em out for that reason alone. Or go see 'em because they're the legendary, constantly evolving international punk band from the 90's that you didn't know existed. Bring 'em a falafel! Buy 'em a beer. Tell 'em hi. They're seriously the nicest dudes in rock and roll. And my research indicates that they once played a huge fest in Europe while tripping on shrooms. That's pretty cool.				</description>

        <description>
            The coed feminist punk band War On Women was formed in 2010 by several veterans of the Baltimore rock scene, including members of AVEC and Liars Academy. Describing their sound as "early Metallica meets Bikini Kill,"Â War On Women write songs too inventive and too loud to be overshadowed by their equally powerful messages. And their furious, confrontational live sets capture all the brevity and intensity of hardcore punk with a whole other level of lyrical and musical sophistication.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            War On Women's songs attack the sexist attitudes and institutionalized patriarchy women everywhere still face in the 21st century with humor, intelligence, righteous anger and monster riffs. "Broken Record" sneers back at misogynist catcalls, while "Effemimania," named after a term coined by transgender activist Julia Serano, calls for the same kinds of united efforts across and beyond gender lines collectively represented by the two women and three men in War On Women.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            In 2012, War On Women released their debut 10" vinyl EP, Improvised Weapons, on Exotic Fever Records, an assured and fully realized document of the band's sound and philosophy.				</description>

            Unhappy with the current state of ska music, We Are The Union decided to stick out their own necks and tried to change things for the better in the summer of 2005. Getting a paycheck is not on their agenda. Instead of following typical ska punk conventions, WATU takes a harder-nosed approach to the genre. With influences ranging from Philadelphia/New Jersey favorites Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, and bands like Slapstick and This Is A Standoff, they rage with the best of them while still retaining a heightened sense of melody.				</description>

            Wetlands started in September of 2011 in the marshes of St. Augustine. In this short time, they've released a demo and a 17-song full length album recorded by the Fest's veteran, Jacob Hamilton (Alligator, Solid Pony, Tubers, and Rivernecks) and completed a 2-week southeastern tour as well as a few short Florida tours. A first in St. Augustine's ever-growing music scene, their seemingly antique, Appalachian-esque sound has paved it's way into the hearts of even the most particular of punks.				</description>

            The 'Ë90s were rife with talented, passionate, and engaging bands who built upon the legacies of their forebearers while pushing the envelope as far as they could, crafting a myriad of fresh and provoking sounds. One of the epicenters was Virginia, former home of the Confederacy and lately a crucible of pluralism. A land where urban uproots rural and tradition trades blows with progress, forging a cultural battleground strewn with ideological rubble. It was here that the gentlemen of Worn In Red came of age, bearing witness to a generation of bands who now live on only in record store lore, all of whom left a lasting impression on the few who were there when it happened. Worn In Red draw on the elements these bands held most dear; a fiercly independent ethic that celebrates the power and capability we all hold, a desperation and darkness brought on by the constant personal struggle with society, and an unflinchingly honest approach to musical and artistic expression. With ideals intact, they unleash their aggression in a hail of gutted screams, churning rhythms, and triumphantly soaring melodies. Look for a NEW FULL-LENGTH in July on NO IDEA RECORDS.				</description>

            Xerxes took shape in early 2009 in Louisville, KY. What was once may soon again be the hub of some of the most ferocious and original music coming out of the country's punk and hardcore underbelly. Xerxes' sound channels the energy and passion of mid-90's originators, while adding the more upbeat and brutal thrash mentality, making for a sound that runs the gamut of blast-beat aggression and emotional rumination.				</description>

            Hailing from Portland, Young Turks returns to Fest for their second year in a row. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            Formed in the rainy winter of 2010, Young Turks carved a niche for themselves with their debut 7" "Halfhearted" (Arctic Circle Pit Records). A charged effort of fast riffs and pounding drums laid a path where fans of Suicide File and Defeater could meet. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
            After several tours in support of "Halfhearted", the addition of Mason on drums, and their signing with Animal Style Records, Young Turks are rapidly approaching the release of their debut 12" this summer. Building on the EP, new songs like "Knife Club" and "Priceline" give new depth to the band. Emotions harnessed and honed. The end result is furious and focused. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
